## v0.4.5

### New features

- Decouple epoch advance from finalization, allowing them to run as independent processes with separate retry mechanisms
- Implement sync waiting mechanism to ensure GenVM has latest state before contract execution
- Add `genlayer_node_info` Prometheus metric exposing node and protocol version

### Bug fixes

- Add canPrime check to verify epoch state before validator priming, preventing priming when epochs are out of sync
- Return user-friendly error instead of system error when sync times out
- Fix genvm executor process handling

### Misc

- Improve GenVM logging with context-aware logger
- Update health checker to use ZkSync connectivity checks
- Increase default genvm permits to 8 in config.yaml.example
