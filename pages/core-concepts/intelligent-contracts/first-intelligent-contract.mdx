# Your First **Intelligent** Contract

Now is the time to utilize all the power of GenLayer!

For blockchain integrity reasons, non-determinism must be contained within special non-deterministic blocks. Such blocks are regular Python functions with no arguments, which can return arbitrary values. However, there are some limitations:
- Storage is inaccessible from non-deterministic blocks
- State of the Python interpreter is not passed back to the deterministic code (for instance, you won't see changes in global variables)

### Simple Case
To illustrate how it works, let's get a webpage as plain HTML, and verify that it has a link to the owner:

```py
example_web_address = 'https://example.org'
def my_non_deterministic_block():
    web_data = gl.get_webpage(example_web_address, mode='html')
    return 'iana' in web_data

print(gl.eq_principle_strict_eq(my_non_deterministic_block))
```

Here are a few important parts:
1. It is **mandatory** to call `gl.get_webpage` from a function invoked via `gl.eq_principle_*`, otherwise it will give an error
2. Type annotations are not required
3. `example_web_address` gets captured without the need to specify it explicitly
4. We are getting the page in plain HTML, because we want text from a link (`<a>` HTML tag), which is not visible in the text representation
5. We are using `eq_principle_strict_eq` because we return a `bool` (`True` or `False`), so there is no need to run LLMs or other complex computations: validators will agree _if_ they both get the exactly the same result, which makes sense for our case. However, if you wish to return more complex data (such as a text summary), you should use other `eq_principle`. More on this topic on the next page

### As a Full Contract
```py
# { "Depends": "py-genlayer:test" }

from genlayer import *

@gl.contract
class Contract:
    had_iana: bool

    def __init__(self):
        example_web_address = 'https://example.org'
        def my_non_deterministic_block():
            web_data = gl.get_webpage(example_web_address, mode='html')
            return 'iana' in web_data
        self.had_iana = gl.eq_principle_strict_eq(my_non_deterministic_block)
```
