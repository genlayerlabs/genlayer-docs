# Managing Intelligent Contract Operations with the Equivalence Principle

The Equivalence Principle is a core concept in GenLayer's Intelligent Contract framework. It ensures consistency and reliability when handling non-deterministic operation results, such as responses from Large Language Models or web data retrieval, by establishing a standard for validators to agree on the correctness of these outputs. These functions give users detailed control over how the outputs are validated.

Depending on how you want the validators to work, you can choose from a few options, such as a principle that uses LLMs or one that just uses a strict comparison.

The Equivalence Principle involves multiple validators randomly selected to determine whether different outputs from non-deterministic operations can be considered equivalent. One validator acts as the leader, proposing the output, while others validate it and then return it instead of their computation.

## Equivalence Principles Options

Validators work to reach a consensus on whether the result set by the leader is acceptable, which might involve direct comparison or qualitative evaluation, depending on the contract's design. If the validators do not reach a consensus due to differing data interpretations or an error in data processing, the result might be challenged or an appeal process might be initiated.

### Comparative Equivalence Principle

In the Comparative Equivalence Principle, the leader and the validators perform identical tasks and then directly compare their respective results with the predefined criteria to ensure consistency and accuracy. This method uses an acceptable margin of error to handle slight variations in results between validators and is suitable for quantifiable outputs. However, computational demands and associated costs increase since multiple validators perform the same tasks as the leader.

```python
gl.eq_principle_prompt_comparative(
    your_non_det_function,
    "The result must not differ by more than 5%"
)
```
For example, if an intelligent contract is tasked with fetching the follower count of a Twitter account and the Equivalence Principle specifies that _follower counts should not differ by more than 5%_, validators will compare their results to the leader's result utilizing LLMs to ensure they fall within this margin.

### Non-Comparative Equivalence Principle

In contrast, the Non-Comparative Equivalence Principle does not require validators to replicate the leader's output, which makes the validation process faster and less costly. Instead, validators assess the accuracy of the leader's result against the criteria defined in the Equivalence Principle. This method is particularly useful for qualitative outputs like text summaries.

## Ideal Scenarios

- Complex decision-making processes that might require fetching and processing large amounts of data
- Situations where outputs from different operations need to be cross-validated against each other
- Tasks that involve sequential steps where each step might affect the outcome of the next
