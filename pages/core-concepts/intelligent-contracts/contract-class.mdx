## Defining the Intelligent Contract Class

An Intelligent Contract in GenLayer is defined using a Python class that inherits from `IContract`. This ensures your contract integrates smoothly with the GenVM environment, providing the necessary properties and behaviors for execution.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Inheriting from `IContract` is mandatory for all Intelligent Contracts in GenLayer to ensure proper integration and functionality.
</Callout>

```python
import json
from genvm.base.icontract import IContract
from genvm.base.equivalence_principle import call_llm_with_principle

class WizardOfCoin(IContract):
    def __init__(self, have_coin: bool):
        self.have_coin = have_coin
```

In this example code above, the `WizardOfCoin` class inherits from `IContract`. This class serves as the foundation for the Intelligent Contract, equipping it with the necessary structure and capabilities to function within the GenVM environment.
