# GenVM (GenLayer Virtual Machine)

GenVM is the execution environment for Intelligent Contracts in the GenLayer protocol. It serves as the backbone for processing and managing contract operations within the GenLayer ecosystem.

## Purpose of GenVM

The only purpose of GenVM is execution of Intelligent Contracts, which can have non-deterministic code, while maintaining blockchain security and consistency.

In a nutshell, GenVM plays a crucial role in enabling the unique features of GenLayer, bridging the gap between traditional smart contracts and AI-powered, web-connected Intelligent Contracts.

## Key Features That Make GenVM Different

Unlike traditional blockchain virtual machines such as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), GenVM has some advanced features

- **Integration with LLMs**: GenVM facilitates seamless interaction between Intelligent Contracts and Large Language Models
- **Web access**: GenVM provides access to the internet
- **User friendliness**: Intelligent Contracts can be written in Python, which makes learning curve mush more shallow

## How GenVM Works

1. **Contract Deployment**: When an Intelligent Contract is deployed, GenVM compiles and executes the contract code.

2. **Transaction Processing**: As transactions are submitted to the network, GenVM executes the relevant contract functions and produces the next state for the contract.

3. **Stateless**: GenVM is stateless and does not maintain any persistent state between transactions. It executes a transaction with a given snapshot of the state to produce the next state.

## Developer Considerations

When developing Intelligent Contracts for GenVM:

- Utilize Python's robust libraries and features
- Consider potential non-deterministic outcomes when integrating LLMs
- Implement proper error handling for web data access
- Optimize code for efficient execution within the rollup environment
