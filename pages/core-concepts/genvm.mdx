# GenVM (GenLayer Virtual Machine)

GenVM is the execution environment for Intelligent Contracts in the GenLayer protocol. It serves as the backbone for processing and managing contract operations within the GenLayer ecosystem.

## Purpose of GenVM

GenVM's only purpose is to execute Intelligent Contracts, which can have non-deterministic code while maintaining blockchain security and consistency.

In summary, GenVM plays a crucial role in enabling GenLayer's unique features, bridging the gap between traditional smart contracts and AI-powered, web-connected Intelligent Contracts.

## Key Features That Make GenVM Different

Unlike traditional blockchain virtual machines such as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), GenVM has some advanced features.

- **Integration with LLMs**: GenVM facilitates seamless interaction between Intelligent Contracts and Large Language Models
- **Web access**: GenVM provides access to the internet
- **User friendliness**: Intelligent Contracts can be written in Python, which makes the learning curve much more shallow

## How GenVM Works

1. **Contract Deployment**: When an Intelligent Contract is deployed, GenVM compiles and executes the contract code.

2. **Transaction Processing**: As transactions are submitted to the network, GenVM executes the relevant contract functions and produces the contract's next state.

3. **Stateless**: GenVM is stateless and does not maintain any persistent state between transactions. It executes a transaction with a given state snapshot to produce the next state.

## Developer Considerations

When developing Intelligent Contracts for GenVM:

- Utilize Python's robust libraries and features
- Consider potential non-deterministic outcomes when integrating LLMs
- Implement proper error handling for web data access
- Optimize code for efficient execution within the rollup environment
