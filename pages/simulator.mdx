# GenLayer Simulator

The GenLayer Simulator replicates the full GenLayer network, including validators and the execution environment, allowing you to test and interact with Intelligent Contracts in a controlled setting.

With our user-friendly interface, the simulator lets you initiate and monitor transactions, tweak contract parameters, and view results in real-time.
