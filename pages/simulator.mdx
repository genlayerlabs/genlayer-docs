# GenLayer Simulator

This Simulator is an interactive sandbox designed for developers to explore the potential of GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts. It replicates the GenLayer network's execution environment and consensus algorithm, but offers a controlled and local environment to test different ideas and behaviors.

### What you can do with the GenLayer Simulator:

- **Experiment with AI smart contracts:** Intelligent Contracts leverage LLMs, such as GPT-4 or Llama3, to understand natural language and be capable of complex decision making.

- **Access the Web Natively:** Genlayer is the first platform where smart contracts donâ€™t need oracles to access the internet.

- **Code in Python:** Develop in a familiar, developer-friendly language, where memory and string management are not a big headache.
