# Validator Upgrade Guide

Before upgrading, check the [changelog](/validators/changelog) for the target version to determine whether the upgrade is **breaking** or **non-breaking**.

| Upgrade Type | How to Identify | Database | Downtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Non-breaking** | Patch/minor release, no consensus contract changes | Carries over | Minimal |
| **Breaking** | Changelog mentions "upgrade consensus contracts" or new consensus deployment | Must be deleted | Full restart required |

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  When in doubt, treat it as a breaking change — the only cost is a longer sync time.

## Non-Breaking Upgrade

You can minimize downtime by preparing the new version while your current node is still running.

1. **Download and extract into a fresh folder** — See [download instructions](/validators/setup-guide#download-the-node-software). Always use a clean directory.
2. **Run GenVM setup** — `python3 ./third_party/genvm/bin/setup.py`
3. **Configure the new version** — Set up `config.yaml` and `.env` as described in the [configuration section](/validators/setup-guide#configuration). You can reference your previous settings, but **do not blindly copy config files** — new versions may include updated defaults or new fields.
4. **Copy the data folder** — Copy `data/` from your old installation to the new one (contains database and keystore). Skip this if your `datadir` points outside the project directory.
5. **Validate** — Run `./bin/genlayernode doctor` and ensure all checks pass.
6. **Switch over** — Stop the old node, then start the new one.

## Breaking Change Upgrade

Breaking changes involve a new consensus deployment. The old database is incompatible, so it cannot be reused. Your operator key, validator wallet, and staked GEN are **not affected** — no re-staking is needed.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Always back up your keystore before a breaking upgrade.** You can copy the `data/node/keystore/` directory or use `genlayernode account export`. See [backing up your operator key](/validators/setup-guide#backing-up-your-operator-key).
</Callout>

1. **Read the changelog** — Check the [changelog](/validators/changelog) for version-specific instructions and what changed.
2. **Back up your keystore** — Copy `data/node/keystore/` to a safe location.
3. **Download and extract into a fresh folder** — See [download instructions](/validators/setup-guide#download-the-node-software).
4. **Run GenVM setup** — `python3 ./third_party/genvm/bin/setup.py`
5. **Configure from scratch** — Create `config.yaml` and `.env` using the new example files as a base. **Do not copy your old config** — the schema may have changed. Refer to the [configuration section](/validators/setup-guide#configuration) for the current format.
6. **Import your operator key** — Copy your backed-up keystore into `data/node/keystore/`, or re-import using the CLI. See [restoring your operator key](/validators/setup-guide#restoring-your-operator-key).
7. **Do NOT copy the old database** — Delete `data/node/genlayer.db` if you accidentally copied the full `data/` folder. The node will create a fresh database and sync from genesis.
8. **Validate** — Run `./bin/genlayernode doctor` and ensure all checks pass.
9. **Stop the old node, start the new one.**

## Migration Notes

### v0.4.x to v0.5.0 (Breaking)

- The five separate consensus contract addresses (`contractmanageraddress`, `contractmainaddress`, etc.) have been replaced by a single `consensusaddress` field. Do not copy your old consensus config — use the new example `config.yaml`.
- Genesis block changed from `817855` to `17326`.
- Database must be wiped (the node creates a fresh one on startup).
- No re-staking required — your operator key, validator wallet, and staked GEN are unaffected.

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

- **Node won't start** — Run `./bin/genlayernode doctor`. If it reports unknown config fields, reconfigure from the new example.
- **Not participating in consensus** — Verify the consensus contract address, `validatorWalletAddress`, and `operatorAddress` are correct.
- **Key errors** — Your operator key wasn't imported. See [restoring your operator key](/validators/setup-guide#restoring-your-operator-key).
- **Slow sync after breaking upgrade** — Expected. Ensure `genesis` is set in `config.yaml` to avoid scanning from block 0.
