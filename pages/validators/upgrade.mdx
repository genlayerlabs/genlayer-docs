# Validator upgrade guide

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  For non-breaking changes, you can minimize the downtime by keeping your existing validator node running while
  you download and configure the new version according to the steps below. Once
  the upgrade is fully configured and ready to run, stop the old node and
  start the new one. 

  A fully Zero-downtime upgrade procedure is coming in a future update. 
</Callout>

## Configuration Change

`v0.3.8` introduces updated consensus contract deployment with new contract addresses. **Critical**: Some consensus contract addresses have changed, and validators must update their consensus configuration to continue participating in the network.

- Stop the node if it is running.
- Back up your `configs/node/config.yaml` file to preserve your current settings.
- Download and install the new `v0.3.8` packaged binary.
- **Update the new configuration with any changes you had previously applied (you can check your config.yaml backup) and make sure you have the following consensus contracts** in your `configs/node/config.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  consensus:
    # Asimov - Phase 3
    contractmanageraddress: "0x0761ff3847294eb3234f37Bf63fd7F1CA1E840bB" # ConsensusManager Smart Contract Address
    contractmainaddress: "0xe30293d600fF9B2C865d91307826F28006A458f4" # ConsensusMain Smart Contract Address
    contractdataaddress: "0x2a50afD9d3E0ACC824aC4850d7B4c5561aB5D27a" # ConsensusData Smart Contract Address
    contractidlenessaddress: "0xD1D09c2743DD26d718367Ba249Ee1629BE88CF33" # Idleness Smart Contract Address
    contractstakingaddress: "0x31Cb4018ccB7d4F30419d367b6C5c7677AAE30E7" # Staking Smart Contract Address
    genesis: 817855 # Genesis block number for this consensus deployment
  ```
- **Verify your configuration** by running `genlayernode doctor` - this will validate all contract addresses and connectivity.
- Start the node with the updated configuration.

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
  **Critical: Staking Address Update Required**
  
  Failure to update the consensus contract addresses will prevent your validator from:
  - Participating in consensus rounds
  - Being selected as an activator, a leader or activator
  
  The `doctor` command will now specifically validate these addresses - ensure it passes before starting your node.
</Callout>

## v0.2 → v0.3 (Breaking Change)

`v0.3` switches to a new consensus deployment. For this reason, the validator must be set up from scratch without reusing the old database stored at `data/node/genlayer.db`.
You do not need to keep your existing validator node running while you download and configure the new version.

- Stop the node if it is running.
- Back up the configs/node/config.yaml file so that you can refer to any values you have set in the previous version.
- Download the packaged binary.
- Install the new version. 
- Remove the storage folder `data/node/genlayer.db`.
- Check that configuration is correct by running `genlayernode doctor` command.
- Start the node.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Install the new version in the same directory as the previous installation. This ensures that any paths referenced in the configuration remain the same and 
  helps maintain continuity in your setup.
  If you want to install the new version in a different directory, copy your `data/keystore` and `configs/node/wallet.yaml` to the new directory to keep using 
  the same wallet.
</Callout>


## v0.1.0-testnet008 → v0.2.0-testnet001

- GenVM configuration has changed, please follow the new instructions in the GenVM configuration section in the validator setup guide.
- Back up the `configs/node/config.yaml`, `configs/node/wallet.yaml`, and `data/node/keystore` folders so you can retain your previous configuration and wallet access.
