# Validator upgrade guide

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  For non-breaking changes, you can minimize the downtime by keeping your existing validator node running while
  you download and configure the new version according to the steps below. Once
  the upgrade is fully configured and ready to run, stop the old node and
  start the new one. 

  A fully Zero-downtime upgrade procedure is coming in a future update. 
</Callout>

## General Procedure

1. **Download the new package and extract into a fresh folder** - Always use a clean directory for the new version.
2. **Override with your custom config** - Configure the files in the new installation as you did when [setting up your node](/validators/setup-guide). Example: `.env` and `config.yaml`. You can refer to your previous settings. Avoid directly copying these files, as new versions may include updated default configurations.
3. **Copy the contents of your old data folder** - The `data/` folder is the stateful directory used by the node, containing the database and keystore. This step is not needed if your data folder is located outside of the project directory.
4. **Run genvm setup** - Running `python3 ./third_party/genvm/bin/setup.py` to set up the GenVM environment.
