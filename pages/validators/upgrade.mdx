# Validator upgrade guide

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  For upgrades prior to <strong>v0.3.0</strong>, you can keep your existing validator node running while
  you download and configure the new version according to the steps below. Once
  the upgrade is fully configured and ready to run, stop the old node and
  start the new one.
</Callout>

## v0.3.0

`v0.3.0` introduces a new, fresh consensus deployment. For this reason, the validator must be set up from scratch without reusing the previous `data/genlayer.db` folder.
You do not need to keep your existing validator node running while you download and configure the new version.

- Stop the node if it is running.
- Back up the configs/node/config.yaml file so that you can refer to any values you have set in the previous version.
- Download the packaged application.
- Install the new version. 
- Remove the storage folder `data/genlayer.db`.
- Start the node.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Install the new version in the same directory as the previous installation. This ensures that any paths referenced in the configuration remain the same and 
  helps maintain continuity in your setup.
  If you wanna install the new version in a different directory, copy your `data/keystore` and `configs/node/wallet.yaml` to the new directory to keep using 
  the same wallet.
</Callout>


## v0.1.0-testnet008 → v0.2.0-testnet001

- GenVM configuration has changed, please follow the new instructions in the GenVM configuration section in the validator setup guide.
- Back up the `configs/node/config.yaml`, `configs/node/wallet.yaml`, and `data/keystore` folders so you can retain your previous configuration and wallet access.
