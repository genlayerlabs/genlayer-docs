# Validator upgrade guide

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  To minimize downtime, you can keep your existing validator node running while
  you download and configure the new version according to the steps below. Once
  the new version is fully configured and ready to run, stop the old node and
  start the new one.
</Callout>

## v0.3.0

`v0.3.0` comes with a new fresh consensus deployment. For this reason, set up the validator from scratch, without reusing previous `data` folder

## v0.1.0-testnet008 â†’ v0.2.0-testnet001

- GenVM configuration has changed, please follow the new instructions in the GenVM configuration section in the validator setup guide.
- Back up the configs/node/config.yaml file so that you can refer to any values you have set in the previous version.
