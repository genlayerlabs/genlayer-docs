# Setting Up Your GenLayer Validator

Running a GenLayer Validator node ensures the security and reliability of the GenLayer network. Below are the requirements for running a GenLayer validator.

## Dependencies

### LLM Access

Each validator needs access to a Large Language Model (LLM) for executing and evaluating Intelligent Contracts.

It is up to each validator to select the model they want to use.

Possible options:

- Run an open-source model locally on the same machine with a GPU
- Run an open-source model on a different machine
- Connect to a hosted inference provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Heurist, Atoma network etc.)

### ZKSync Full Node for the GenLayer Chain

Each validator needs access to a [ZKSync Full Node](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/external-node) connected to the GenLayer chain. Validators use this node to read the chain state and submit transactions.

One full node can be shared between multiple validators. The optimal validator-to-node ratio is currently under evaluation.

## System Requirements

Below are the **initial** recommended system requirements. These guidelines may change as the network grows and evolves.

### RAM

- **Recommended:** 16 GB
- **Why:**
  - GenLayer's _genvm_ can spawn multiple Sub-VMs for contract calls and non-deterministic blocks.
  - Each Sub-VM can consume up to ~4 GB of RAM for storage.

### CPU

- **Recommended:** Modern multi-core processor with at least 8 cores/16 threads

#### Architecture

- **Recommended:** `AMD64`
- `ARM64` is not supported at this time

### Storage

- **Recommended Disk Space:** 128 GB+
- **Preferred Type:** SSD or NVMe (M.2)

### Network

- 100 Mbps connection
- **Recommended:**: 1 Gbps+

### GPU (Optional)

- GPU is **Not Required**
- If you want to run LLMs locally, you will need to select appropriate hardware (typically a CUDA-compatible GPU with sufficient VRAM for the model you intend to use)

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  These requirements are a starting point. As GenLayer evolves and usage
  patterns change (e.g., more complex AI-driven Intelligent Contracts), the
  recommended hardware may change.
</Callout>

### Software

- Operating System - 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
- `docker` - for running the WebDriver container

## Setup

### Download the node software

1. Select the version of the node you want to run by checking the available builds

   You can use this command to list available versions:

   ```sh
   curl -s "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/gh-af/o?prefix=genlayer-node/bin/amd64" | grep -o '"name": *"[^"]*"' | sed -n 's/.*\/\(v[^/]*\)\/.*/\1/p' | sort -ru
   ```

   You should see a list like this

   ```sh
      v0.4.0
      v0.3.11
      v0.3.10
      v0.3.9
      v0.3.8
      v0.3.7
      v0.3.6
      v0.3.5
      v0.3.4
      v0.3.3
      v0.3.2
      v0.3.1
      v0.3.0
      v0.2.0-testnet007
      v0.2.0-testnet005
      v0.2.0-testnet004
      v0.2.0-testnet003
      v0.2.0-testnet002
      v0.2.0-testnet001
   ```

   Typically, you will want to run the latest version

2. Download the packaged application
   ```sh
   export version=v0.4.0 # set your desired version here
   wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gh-af/genlayer-node/bin/amd64/${version}/genlayer-node-linux-amd64-${version}.tar.gz
   ```
3. Extract the node software
   ```sh
   tar -xzvf genlayer-node-linux-amd64-${version}.tar.gz
   ```
4. Change the directory

   ```sh
   cd genlayer-node-linux-amd64
   ```

5. Run Genvm setup

   ```sh
   ./third_party/genvm/bin/genvm setup
   ```

## Configuration

Before you can start up the node, you need to configure it.

### `config.yaml`

This is the main configuration file of your node. Without it, your node won't start

The file needs to be located at `configs/node/config.yaml`

You can use the following example configuration. **Note:** For most users, you will only need to modify the `zksyncurl` and `zksyncwebsocketurl` values below.

```yaml
# rollup configuration
rollup:
  genlayerchainrpcurl: "TODO: Set your GenLayer Chain ZKSync HTTP RPC URL here" # GenLayer Chain RPC URL

```

### GenVM Configuration

You need to set up an LLM for your node to use to provide answers to natural language prompts. You can use any LLM you wish, however the quality of its answers will affect the performance of your node.

<Callout>
  GenLayer has partnered with multiple LLM providers to offer free credits for validators:

  **[Heurist](https://www.heurist.ai/)** - A Layer 2 network for AI model hosting and inference, built on the ZK Stack. It offers serverless access to open-source AI models through a decentralized network. GenLayer Validators can obtain free [Heurist API credits](https://dev-api-form.heurist.ai) by using the referral code: _"genlayer"_.

  **[Comput3](https://genlayer.comput3.ai/)** - A decentralized compute network providing access to various AI models. GenLayer Validators can use the Comput3.ai inferencing API with access to llama3, hermes3 and qwen3 models. Validators can obtain free [Comput3 API credits](https://genlayer.comput3.ai/) to get started with their validator setup.

  **[io.net](/partners/ionet)** - A decentralized compute network providing GPU access for AI inference. GenLayer Validators can create an account at [id.io.net](https://id.io.net/login) and obtain free credits by [filling out this form](https://form.typeform.com/to/pDmCCViV).
</Callout>

The GenVM configuration files are located at `third_party/genvm/config/`

#### `genvm-module-llm.yaml`

This is the configuration file of the LLM module. In this file you can set up and configure various LLM providers, as well as the system prompts of your validator.

You can turn on and off various LLMs by setting the `enabled` field to `false`.

At this stage, select one LLM and set all other to disabled.

Note environment variable names for LLM API keys (e.g., `HEURISTKEY`, `COMPUT3KEY`, `IOINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY`). You will need to ensure the appropriate key is correctly set before [running the node](#running-the-node).

#### `genvm-module-web.yaml`

This is the configuration of webdriver module that enables the GenVM to access the internet. You should not need to modify this.

#### `genvm.yaml`

This is the configuration of the GenVM itself, such as how many threads it can use and what are the addresses of various modules. You should not need to edit this file either.

2. Run precompilation of pre-delivered wasm modules (this step is optional but is **highly** recommended for improved performance)
   ```bash
   ./third_party/genvm/bin/genvm precompile
   ```
   Precompilation should be re-run after switching to a different node release

#### Greyboxing LLMs

Greyboxing is a way to further customise your LLM setup to improve its performance as well as security.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  Greyboxing is an advanced feature. Familiarity with Lua scripting and LLM
  prompt engineering is recommended for customization.
</Callout>

`genvm-modules llm` provides user with ability to customize [greyboxing](/_temp/security-and-best-practices/grey-boxing) via lua scripting. Right now users can customize prompt templates, specify temperature and system prompt.

Related scripts are located at:

1. `./scripts/genvm-greyboxing.lua` – user defined script
2. `./share/lib/genvm/greyboxing/lib-greyboxing.lua` – more low-level library

<Callout emoji="🏗️">
  More features and built-in filters will be added soon
</Callout>

### Set Up The Validator Key

In this step we'll generate your validator key and address.

    ```sh
    ./bin/genlayernode account new -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml --setup --password "your secret password" # Remember it! You will need it to unlock your account when running the node
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```sh
    Account created:
      New address: 0xA0b12Fd2f3F7e86fEC458D114A5E7a6f571160a8
      Account setup as a validator
    ```

<Callout type="info">
  Currently the GenLayer Testnet is permissioned. You can apply to be selected
  [by filling out the following
  form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7YujY6S6knB9XC8kL-2wsgNHrweqULstgc-OOMERlRsfg0A/viewform)
</Callout>

### Backing Up Your Validator Key

After generating your validator key, it is critical to back it up securely.

You can export your key using the following command:

```sh
./bin/genlayernode account export \
--password "your node password" \
--address "your validator address" \
--passphrase "your backup encryption passphrase" \
--path "/path/to/your/secure/backup.key" \
-c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚨">
  **Important: Back up your validator key!** Losing access to this key means
  losing control of your validator and any associated rewards. Store the backup
  securely. Remember both the node password (used during setup) and the backup
  encryption passphrase.
</Callout>

To print (display) the private key from your exported backup file, you can use the `--print` flag
with the account export command. This will output the private key in plain text to your terminal.
**Keep this private key secure and never share it.** You can use this private key to set up any other
EVM-compatible wallet such as MetaMask.

### Importing (Restoring) Your Validator Key

If you need to restore your validator key from a backup (for example, after migrating to a new server or recovering from data loss), you can import it using the following command:

```sh
./bin/genlayernode account import \
  --password "your node password" \
  --passphrase "your backup encryption passphrase" \
  --path "/path/to/your/secure/backup.key" \
  -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml \
  --setup
```

You should see the following output:

```sh
  Account imported:
    Address: 0xA0b12Fd2f3F7e86fEC458D114A5E7a6f571160a8
    Account setup as a validator
```

- The validator key will be imported and available for use by your node.

- You can now start your node as usual.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚨">
  Important: Always verify that your imported key works by checking your
  validator address.
</Callout>

### Validator Joining the Network

This section walks you through becoming a validator on the GenLayer testnet using the CLI.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- GenLayer CLI installed (`npm install -g genlayer`)
- GEN tokens for staking (minimum stake required)

#### Step 1: Create an Account

```bash
genlayer account create
```

You'll be prompted to set a password. This creates an encrypted keystore file.

#### Step 2: View Your Account

```bash
genlayer account
```

Output:

```
{
  address: '0x86D0d159483CBf01E920ECfF8bB7F0Cd7E964E7E',
  balance: '0 GEN',
  network: 'localnet',
  status: 'locked'
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Network to Testnet

```bash
genlayer network testnet-asimov
```

Verify with:

```bash
genlayer account
```

You should see `network: 'Asimov Testnet'`.

#### Step 4: Fund Your Account

Transfer GEN tokens to your address. You can:

- Use the faucet (if available)
- Transfer from another account:

```bash
genlayer account send <your-address> 50000gen
```

#### Step 5: Check Staking Requirements

```bash
genlayer staking epoch-info
```

Output:

```
{
  currentEpoch: '2',
  epochStarted: '2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z',
  nextEpochEstimate: '2025-01-16T00:00:00.000Z',
  timeUntilNextEpoch: '12h 30m',
  minEpochDuration: '24h 0m',
  validatorMinStake: '42000 GEN',
  delegatorMinStake: '42 GEN',
  activeValidatorsCount: '6',
  epochInflation: '1000 GEN',
  totalWeight: '500000000000000000000000',
  totalClaimed: '500 GEN'
}
```

Note the `validatorMinStake` - you need at least this amount.

#### Step 6: Unlock Your Account (Optional)

For convenience, unlock your account to avoid entering password repeatedly:

```bash
genlayer account unlock
```

This caches your private key in the OS keychain.

#### Step 7: Join as Validator

```bash
genlayer staking validator-join --amount 42000gen --operator 0xOperator...
```

Options:

- `--amount <amount>` - Stake amount (e.g., `42000gen` or `42000`)
- `--operator <address>` - Operator address (recommended, see below)

##### Why Use an Operator Address?

<Callout type="info">
**Recommended:** Use a separate operator address for security.
</Callout>

- **Validator wallet** - Holds your staked funds (keep offline/cold)
- **Operator wallet** - Signs blocks and performs validator duties (hot wallet on server)

This way, if your operator server is compromised, your staked funds remain safe.

```bash
# Create operator account on your validator server
genlayer account create --output ./operator.json

# Get operator address
cat ./operator.json | jq -r .address
# 0xOperator123...

# Join with separate operator (run from your main wallet)
genlayer staking validator-join --amount 42000gen --operator 0xOperator123...
```

You can change the operator later:

```bash
genlayer staking set-operator --validator 0xYourValidator... --operator 0xNewOperator...
```

#### Step 8: Verify Your Validator Status

```bash
genlayer staking validator-info
```

Output:

```
{
  validator: '0x86D0d159483CBf01E920ECfF8bB7F0Cd7E964E7E',
  vStake: '42000 GEN',
  vShares: '42000000000000000000000',
  live: true,
  banned: 'Not banned',
  ...
}
```

#### Step 9: Set Validator Identity (Metadata)

Set your validator's public identity so delegators can find you:

```bash
genlayer staking set-identity \
  --validator 0x86D0...7E \
  --moniker "My Validator" \
  --website "https://myvalidator.com" \
  --description "Reliable validator with 99.9% uptime" \
  --twitter "myvalidator" \
  --github "myvalidator"
```

**Required:**

- `--validator <address>` - Your validator address
- `--moniker <name>` - Display name for your validator

**Optional:**

- `--logo-uri <uri>` - Logo image URL
- `--website <url>` - Website URL
- `--description <text>` - Description of your validator
- `--email <email>` - Contact email
- `--twitter <handle>` - Twitter handle
- `--telegram <handle>` - Telegram handle
- `--github <handle>` - GitHub handle
- `--extra-cid <cid>` - Additional data as IPFS CID

Your identity will show in `validator-info`:

```bash
genlayer staking validator-info
```

Output will include:

```
{
  ...
  identity: {
    moniker: 'My Validator',
    website: 'https://myvalidator.com',
    twitter: 'myvalidator',
    github: 'myvalidator'
  }
}
```

#### Managing Your Validator

##### Add More Stake

```bash
genlayer staking validator-deposit --amount 1000gen
```

##### Check Active Validators

```bash
genlayer staking active-validators
```

##### Exit as Validator

```bash
genlayer staking validator-exit --shares 100
```

This initiates a withdrawal. Your tokens enter an **unbonding period of 7 epochs** before they can be claimed.

Check your pending withdrawals with `validator-info`:

```
selfStakePendingWithdrawals: [
  {
    epoch: '5',
    shares: '100',
    stake: '100 GEN',
    claimableAtEpoch: '12',
    status: 'Unbonding (4 epochs remaining)'
  }
]
```

##### Claim Withdrawals

After the 7-epoch unbonding period:

```bash
genlayer staking validator-claim
```

#### Troubleshooting

##### "No account found"

Run `genlayer account create` first.

##### "Insufficient balance"

Ensure you have enough GEN. Check with `genlayer account`.

##### "Below minimum stake"

Check minimum with `genlayer staking epoch-info` and increase your stake amount.

##### Transaction Stuck

Check the transaction status:

```bash
genlayer receipt <tx-hash>
```

#### Lock Your Account

When done, lock your account to remove the cached private key:

```bash
genlayer account lock
```

## Running the node

Once you have configured everything, you are ready to start the node.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚨">
    **Important: Before starting the node, ensure you have the operator address and validator wallet address
    set up. If you do not have setup the validator wallet address, your node will not be able to validate,
    therefore it will act as a full node instead.
</Callout>

### Running the Node using the binary

1.  Set the LLM Provider API Key

    Set the appropriate environment variable for your chosen LLM provider:

    ```sh
    # For Heurist
    export HEURISTKEY='your_heurist_api_key'
    
    # For Comput3
    export COMPUT3KEY='your_comput3_api_key'
    
    # For io.net
    export IOINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY='your_ionet_api_key'
    
    # For other providers, use the appropriate environment variable name
    ```

2.  Run the WebDriver container

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d # Starts the WebDriver needed by the GenVM web module
    ```

3.  (Optional) Run two services (modules) in background (this is a crucial step for running _Intelligent_ contracts). This can be done automatically or manually.
    - To start them automatically in node configuration set `genvm.manage_modules` to `true`
    - To start them manually run
      ```bash
       ./third_party/genvm/bin/genvm-modules web & ./third_party/genvm/bin/genvm-modules llm &
      ```

<Callout type="info">
  Note: If you are using the default configuration, `genvm.manage_modules` is
  set to `true` by default, meaning the node will manage these modules
  automatically.
</Callout>

4. Checking Your Configuration

    To ensure your node is correctly configured, you can run the following command:

    ```sh
    ./bin/genlayernode doctor
    ```

    The `doctor` command now includes comprehensive GenVM diagnostics integration to validate:
    - Consensus contract configuration and accessibility
    - GenVM module connectivity and health status
    - LLM provider configuration and API connectivity
    - Network configuration and ZKSync node accessibility

5.  Run the node

    ```sh
    ./bin/genlayernode run -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml --password "your secret password" # The same password you used when creating the account
    ```

<Callout type="info">
  If you are running the node via SSH, the process might terminate if your
  connection drops. To prevent this, consider using a terminal multiplexer like
  `screen` or `tmux` to keep the node running in the background even if your SSH
  session ends. You can find a guide on using `screen`
  [here](https://www.networkworld.com/article/967925/how-the-linux-screen-tool-can-save-your-tasks-and-your-sanity-if-ssh-is-interrupted.html).
</Callout>

### Running the Node using docker-compose

You can also run the GenLayer node using Docker and Docker Compose.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  webdriver-container:
    container_name: genlayer-node-webdriver
    image: yeagerai/genlayer-genvm-webdriver:0.0.9

      - node

```

2. Create `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml` for Docker networking:

The extracted tarball includes `third_party/genvm/config/genvm-module-web.yaml` configured for `localhost`, which works when running
the binary directly. For docker-compose, you need a version that points to the webdriver service name.

Create `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml`:

- Copy the contents of `third_party/genvm/config/genvm-module-web.yaml` into `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml`.
- Modify the `webdriver_host` configuration to use the service name `webdriver-container` instead of `localhost`:

```yaml
webdriver_host: http://webdriver-container:4444
```

This allows the node container to reach the webdriver container using Docker's internal networking.

The key difference:
- **Binary execution**: uses `localhost:4444` (webdriver runs on same machine)
- **Docker-compose**: uses `webdriver-container:4444` (container service name)


3. Set the required environment variables in a `.env` file:

```env
# GenLayer Node Release Configuration

# =============================================================================
# WebDriver Configuration (required for GenVM)
# =============================================================================
WEBDRIVER_PORT=4444

# =============================================================================
# Node Service Configuration (optional - use node profile)
# =============================================================================
# Docker image version
NODE_VERSION=v0.4.0

# Keystore password (used to unlock the pre-imported wallet)
NODE_PASSWORD=12345678

# Path to node configuration file
NODE_CONFIG_PATH=./configs/node/config.yaml

# Path to node data directory (for persistence)
NODE_DATA_PATH=./data

# Port mappings
NODE_RPC_PORT=9151
NODE_OPS_PORT=9153

# LLM API Key (required for GenVM LLM module)
HEURISTKEY=
ANTHROPICKEY=
XAIKEY=
GEMINIKEY=
ATOMAKEY=
```

or simply use the provided `docker-compose.yaml`, `.env.example` and the `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml` from the extracted tarball.

4. Checking Your Configuration

To ensure your node is correctly configured, you can run the following command:

```sh
source .env && docker run --rm --env-file ./.env \
  -v ${NODE_CONFIG_PATH:-./configs/node/config.yaml}:/app/configs/node/config.yaml \
  yeagerai/genlayer-node:${NODE_VERSION:-v0.4.0} \
  ./bin/genlayernode doctor
```

5. Start the services using Docker Compose:

```sh
source .env && docker compose --profile node up -d
```

## Monitoring with Metrics

GenLayer validators expose comprehensive metrics that are ready for consumption by Prometheus and other monitoring tools. This allows you to monitor your validator's performance, health, and resource usage.

### Accessing Metrics

The metrics endpoint is exposed on the operations port (default: 9153) configured in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
node:
  ops:
    port: 9153 # Metrics port
    endpoints:
      metrics: true # Enable metrics endpoint
```

Once your node is running, you can access the metrics at:
```
http://localhost:9153/metrics
```

### Available Metrics

The validator exposes various metric collectors that can be individually configured:

- **Node Metrics**: Core validator performance metrics including block processing, transaction handling, and consensus participation
- **GenVM Metrics**: Virtual machine performance metrics, including execution times and resource usage
- **WebDriver Metrics**: Metrics related to web access and external data fetching

### Configuring Metrics Collection

You can customize metrics collection in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
metrics:
  interval: "15s"  # Default collection interval
  collectors:
    node:
      enabled: true
      interval: "30s"  # Override interval for specific collector
    genvm:
      enabled: true
      interval: "20s"
    webdriver:
      enabled: true
      interval: "60s"
```

### Example Metrics Query

To check if metrics are working correctly:

```bash
# Get all available metrics
curl http://localhost:9153/metrics

# Check specific metric (example)
curl -s http://localhost:9153/metrics | grep genlayer_node_
```

<Callout type="info">
  The metrics endpoint also provides `/health` and `/balance` endpoints on the same port for additional monitoring capabilities.
</Callout>

### Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Set up alerts** for critical metrics like node synchronization status and missed blocks
2. **Monitor resource usage** to ensure your validator has sufficient CPU, memory, and disk space
3. **Track GenVM performance** to optimize LLM provider selection and configuration
4. **Use visualization tools** like Grafana to create dashboards for easy monitoring

<Callout emoji="📊">
  For production validators, we recommend setting up a complete monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana. This enables real-time visibility into your validator's performance and helps identify issues before they impact your validator's operation.
</Callout>

### Logs and metrics forwarding

You can forward your logs and metrics to external systems for centralized monitoring and alerting by using the service `alloy` provided in the `docker-compose.yaml` from the extracted tarball.
