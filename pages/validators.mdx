# GenLayer Validator Hardware Requirements

Running a GenLayer Validator node ensures the security and reliability of the GenLayer network. Below are the **initial** recommended hardware requirements. These guidelines may change as the network grows and evolves.

## RAM

- **Recommended:** 16 GB  
- **Why:**  
  - GenLayer's _genvm_ can spawn multiple Sub-VMs for contract calls and non-deterministic blocks.  
  - Each Sub-VM can consume up to ~4 GB of RAM for storage.

## CPU

- **Recommended:** Modern multi-core processor with at least 8 cores/16 threads  

## Storage

- **Recommended Disk Space:** 128 GB+  
- **Preferred Type:** SSD or NVMe (M.2)  

## GPU (Optional)

- **Recommended:** If you plan to run advanced AI-models locally, a CUDA-compatible GPU could be beneficial.  

## Network

- **Recommended Connection:** Stable broadband  

## Operating System

- **Recommended:** 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)  

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
    These requirements are a starting point. As GenLayer evolves and usage patterns change (e.g., more complex AI-driven Intelligent Contracts), the recommended hardware may change.
