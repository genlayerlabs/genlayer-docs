# GenLayer Validator Requirements

Running a GenLayer Validator node ensures the security and reliability of the GenLayer network. Below are the requirements for running a GenLayer validator.

## Dependencies

### LLM Access

Each validator needs access to a Large Language Model (LLM) for executing and evaluating Intelligent Contracts.

It is up to each validator to select the model they want to use.

Possible options:
- Run an open-source model locally on the same machine with a GPU
- Run an open-source model on a different machine
- Connect to a hosted inference provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Heurist, Atoma network etc.)

### ZKSync Full Node for the GenLayer Chain

Each validator needs access to a [ZKSync Full Node](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/external-node) connected to the GenLayer chain.

One full node can be shared between multiple validators - TBD how many exactly.


## System Requirements

Below are the **initial** recommended system requirements. These guidelines may change as the network grows and evolves.

### RAM

- **Recommended:** 16 GB  
- **Why:**  
  - GenLayer's _genvm_ can spawn multiple Sub-VMs for contract calls and non-deterministic blocks.  
  - Each Sub-VM can consume up to ~4 GB of RAM for storage.

### CPU

- **Recommended:** Modern multi-core processor with at least 8 cores/16 threads  

### Storage

- **Recommended Disk Space:** 128 GB+  
- **Preferred Type:** SSD or NVMe (M.2)  

### Network

- **Recommended Connection:** Stable broadband  

### Operating System

- **Recommended:** 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.) 

### GPU (Optional)

- **Recommended:** If you plan to run advanced AI-models locally, a CUDA-compatible GPU could be beneficial.

    These requirements are a starting point. As GenLayer evolves and usage patterns change (e.g., more complex AI-driven Intelligent Contracts), the recommended hardware may change.
