# Install GenLayer

The GenLayer CLI supports multiple environments including mainnet, testnet, and the GenLayer Simulator.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the GenLayer CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Required to run GenLayer environment.
- [Node.js and Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/): Needed for the GenLayer CLI tool.

## Installation steps

### 1. Install GenLayer CLI

GenLayer CLI is the main tool for interacting with the GenLayer ecosystem. Install it via npm:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['npm', 'npx']}>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npx install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Initialize the environment

After installing the CLI, set up your development environment:

```bash
genlayer init
```

This command performs several actions:
- Verifies that Docker is installed.
- Downloads and runs the necessary Docker images.
- Initializes the database and sets up the required tables and accounts.
- Launches the simulator and optionally the frontend in your browser.

You'll be notified of the frontend's URL and provided documentation links once the setup completes.

### 3. Start the GenLayer environment

To begin using the GenLayer environment and test your Intelligent Contracts, run the following command:

```bash
genlayer up
```

This command will start the GenLayer environment and the Simulator in your browser with a fresh database and accounts setup.
