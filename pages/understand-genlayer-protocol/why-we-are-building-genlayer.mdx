# Why We Are Building GenLayer
Traditional smart contracts face critical limitations: they can’t natively interact with the outside world without oracles, and their instructions are constrained to code-based logic. By integrating AI at the protocol level, GenLayer’s Intelligent Contracts can:

1. **Process Natural Language**: Interpret and act upon human-readable text prompts.

2. **Access Real-Time Web Data**: Seamlessly fetch and utilize external data.

This synergy opens a world of new applications that merge on-chain trust with off-chain intelligence. Our vision is a dynamic protocol where intelligent entities—ranging from AI models to automated tools—can autonomously transact and reach real-world alignment.

GenLayer's Optimistic Democracy consensus underpins secure, efficient validation even when outputs are inherently non-deterministic. This makes the platform exceptionally adaptable and robust—primed for modern, AI-driven use cases.
