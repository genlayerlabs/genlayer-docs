# Optimistic Democracy: How GenLayer Works

Optimistic Democracy is GenLayer's consensus mechanism, rooted in [Condorcet's Jury Theorem](https://jury-theorem.genlayer.com/) (click the link to check out our interactive model), which affirms that collective decision-making becomes more accurate as independent validators vote. The process unfolds in distinct phases:

1. **Transaction Submission**: A user sends a transaction to the GenLayer network.

2. **Leader Proposes Result**: A validator is randomly chosen as the Leader validator. It processes the transaction and proposes a result.

3. **Validators Recompute**: A committee of validators re-compute the transaction. They either approve or deny based on whether the output aligns with the Leader's result (i.e. is <b>equivalent</b>).

4. **Result Accepted**: Once a majority approves, the result is provisionally accepted.

5. **Appeal**: If any participant disputes the outcome, they can appeal within the Finality Window by posting a bond.

6. **Additional Validation (If Appealed)**: A new set of validators may be chosen to re-evaluate the transaction. If the appeal is valid, they reward the appellant. Otherwise, the bond is forfeited.

7. **Final Decision**: After all appeals are resolved, the outcome becomes final.
