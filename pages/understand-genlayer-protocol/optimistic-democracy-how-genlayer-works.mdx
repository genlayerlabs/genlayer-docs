# Optimistic Democracy: How GenLayer Works

Optimistic Democracy is GenLayer's consensus mechanism, rooted in [Condorcet's Jury Theorem](https://jury-theorem.genlayer.com/) (click the link to check out our interactive model), which affirms that collective decision-making becomes more accurate as independent validators vote. The process unfolds in distinct phases:

1. **User Submits a Transaction** <br />
The user sends a transaction to the GenLayer network.

2. **Leader (Validator) Proposes Result** <br />
A validator is randomly chosen as the Leader-Validator, processes the transaction, and proposes a result.

3. **Validators Recompute** <br />
A committee of validators (Validators) re-computes the transaction. If the output aligns (i.e., is “equivalent”) with the Leader-Validator’s result, they approve; otherwise, they deny.

4. **Result Accepted** <br />
Once a majority approves, the result is provisionally accepted.

5. **Can Appeal** <br />
If any participant disputes the outcome, they can appeal within the Finality Window by posting a bond.

6. **Additional Validation (If Appealed)** <br />
A new set of validators may be chosen to re-evaluate the transaction. If the appeal is valid, they reward the appellant; if not, the bond is forfeited.

7. **Final Decision** <br />
After all appeals are resolved, the outcome becomes final.
