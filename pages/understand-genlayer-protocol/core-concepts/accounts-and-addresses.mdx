# Accounts and Addressing

## Overview

Accounts are fundamental to interacting with the GenLayer network. They represent users or entities that can hold tokens, deploy Intelligent Contracts, and initiate transactions.

## Types of Accounts

1. **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)**: 
   - Controlled by private keys
   - Can initiate transactions and hold tokens

2. **Contract Accounts**: 
   - Associated with deployed Intelligent Contracts
   - Have their own addresses and code

## Account Addresses

- **Address Format**: GenLayer uses a specific address format, typically represented as a hexadecimal string prefixed with `0x`.
- **Public and Private Keys**: Addresses are derived from public keys, which in turn are generated from private keys kept securely by the account owner.

## Interacting with Intelligent Contracts

- **Transaction Sending**: Accounts initiate transactions to call functions on Intelligent Contracts or transfer tokens.
- **Gas Fees**: Transactions require gas fees to be processed.

## Account Management

- **Creating Accounts**: Users can create new accounts using wallets or development tools provided by GenLayer.
- **Security Practices**: Users must securely manage their private keys, as losing them can result in loss of access to their funds.
