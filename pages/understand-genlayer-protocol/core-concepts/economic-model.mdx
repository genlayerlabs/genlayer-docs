# Economic Model

## Overview

GenLayer's economic model is designed to incentivize participants to maintain the network's security and functionality. It involves staking, rewards, transaction fees, and penalties.

## Key Components

- **Staking**: Validators must stake tokens to participate in the validation process, aligning their interests with the network's health.
- **Rewards**: Validators receive rewards for correctly validating transactions.
- **Transaction Fees**: Users pay fees for transaction processing, which are partly used to reward validators.
- **Slashing**: Validators acting maliciously or incompetently can have their staked tokens slashed as a penalty.

## Incentive Mechanisms

- **Positive Incentives**: Rewards and fees motivate validators to act in the network's best interest.
- **Negative Incentives**: Slashing and penalties deter malicious behavior.

## Economic Security

- **Stake-Based Security**: The amount staked by validators serves as a deterrent against attacks, as they risk losing their stake.
- **Balancing Supply and Demand**: The economic model aims to balance the supply of validation services with demand from users.
