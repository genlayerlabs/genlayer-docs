# Non-Deterministic Operations Handling

## Overview

GenLayer extends traditional smart contracts by allowing Intelligent Contracts to perform non-deterministic operations, such as interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and accessing web data. Handling the variability inherent in these operations is crucial for maintaining consensus across the network.

## Challenges

- **Variability of Outputs**: Non-deterministic operations can produce different outputs when executed by different validators.
- **Consensus Difficulty**: Achieving consensus on varying outputs requires specialized mechanisms.

## Solutions in GenLayer

- **Equivalence Principle**: Validators assess whether different outputs are equivalent based on predefined criteria, allowing for consensus despite variability.
- **Optimistic Democracy**: The consensus mechanism accommodates non-deterministic operations by allowing provisional acceptance of transactions and providing an appeals process.

## Developer Considerations

- **Defining Equivalence Criteria**: Developers must specify what constitutes equivalent outputs in their Intelligent Contracts.
- **Testing and Validation**: Thorough testing is essential to ensure that non-deterministic operations behave as expected in the consensus process.
