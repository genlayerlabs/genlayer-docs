## What Are Intelligent Contracts?

Intelligent Contracts are AI-powered smart contracts designed to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs). 
Unlike traditional smart contracts—limited by real-time web data retrieval and natural language processing—
Intelligent Contracts adapt their logic based on live data and evolving conditions.

| **Feature**               | **Traditional Smart Contracts**                                                      | **Intelligent Contracts**                                                                    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Self-executing blockchain programs with terms defined in code                       | AI-driven contracts that access web data and process natural language in real time           |
| **Capabilities**          | Executes predefined on-chain actions based on code logic                            | Executes on-chain actions, can interpret external data, perform AI-driven reasoning, etc.    |
| **Language Understanding**| Limited to code-based commands                                                       | Understands and acts on human-readable text prompts (natural language)                       |
| **Web Data Access**       | Depends on external oracles for off-chain data                                       | Integrates directly with real-time web data, removing the need for external oracles          |
| **Data Handling**         | Can only process data already on-chain                                               | Fetches and utilizes off-chain data (APIs, market info, web resources, etc.)                 |
| **Programming Language**  | Often uses specialized blockchain languages (e.g. Solidity)                          | Generally Python-based in GenLayer, making development more accessible to a broader audience |
| **Ease of Development**   | Requires specialized blockchain knowledge and tooling                                | Accessible via familiar languages (Python) and the GenLayer Studio developer experience       |
| **Flexibility**           | Executes static operations based on predefined logic                                | Can adapt in real time to changing conditions, offering AI-driven functionality              |
| **Consensus Mechanism**   | Relies on standard blockchain consensus (e.g., Proof of Stake, Proof of Work)        | Utilizes Optimistic Democracy for deterministic and non-deterministic contract outputs        |
| **Use Cases**             | Typically restricted to basic on-chain logic like token transfers or deterministic dApps | Enables advanced apps like AI-driven DAOs, predictive analytics, autonomous oracles, etc. |
