# Resetting the GenLayer Simulator
The GenLayer Simulator provides a straightforward way to reset its storage, current status, memory, and contract examples. This feature is particularly useful if you want to start fresh with a clean state, whether youâ€™re testing new contracts or simply clearing out previous configurations.

## How to Reset the Simulator
To reset the GenLayer Simulator, follow these simple steps:

1. **Access the Settings Page**: begin by navigating to the Settings page within the GenLayer Simulator.

3. **Confirm the Reset in the Dialog**: this is an important step, as resetting the storage will remove all existing data and cannot be undone.

Once confirmed, the simulator will reset its storage, returning to its initial state as if it were newly initialized.


## What Does Resetting Do?
Resetting the GenLayer Simulator through the Reset Storage option will:

- Clear All Deployed Contracts: Any contracts that you have deployed in the simulator will be removed from the frontend memory.
- Reset Transaction History: All previous transactions, including those in various states, will be erased.
- Restore Contract Examples: Any example contracts included in the simulator will be restored to their original, unaltered state.

## When Should You Reset?
Consider resetting the simulator when:

- You want to start with a clean slate for a new development or testing session.
- You encounter issues that might be caused by lingering data or state inconsistencies.
- You have completed a testing phase and need to ensure that previous data does not interfere with new experiments.
