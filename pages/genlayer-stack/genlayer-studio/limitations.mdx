# Limitations of the GenLayer Studio

The GenLayer Studio is in an early stage of development, with many features still being tested and refined. Here are some limitations of the studio:

## Native Token Transfers
Native Token transfers to and from contracts are not supported in the Studio.

## Gas Usage
Transactions within the Studio do not consume gas. While this is beneficial for rapid prototyping, the absence of gas simulation may result in behavior differing from live blockchain networks.

## Consensus Algorithm
The GenLayer Studio does not implement the full Optimistic Democracy consensus mechanism. There is no appeals process. The studio focuses on providing a basic execution environment without the complexities of the full consensus mechanism.

## Programming Language
The programming language used in the Studio is an early version and is not final. It is expected to undergo many changes as development progresses.

## Web Access
While the Studio supports web browsing capabilities, it is primarily for testing purposes. The actual web access and data retrieval might differ when deployed on the live network.
