# Resetting the GenLayer Studio
The GenLayer Studio provides a straightforward way to reset its storage, current status, memory, and contract examples. This feature is particularly useful if you want to start fresh with a clean state, whether youâ€™re testing new contracts or simply clearing out previous configurations.

1. **Access the Settings Page**: begin by navigating to the Settings page within the GenLayer Studio.

Once confirmed, the studio will reset its storage, returning to its initial state as if it were newly initialized.


## What Does Resetting Do?
Resetting the GenLayer Studio through the Reset Storage option will:

- Clear All Deployed Contracts: Any contracts that you have deployed in the studio will be removed from the frontend memory.
- Reset Transaction History: All previous transactions, including those in various states, will be erased.
- Restore Contract Examples: Any example contracts included in the studio will be restored to their original, unaltered state.

## When Should You Reset?
Consider resetting the studio when:

- You want to start with a clean slate for a new development or testing session.
- You encounter issues that might be caused by lingering data or state inconsistencies.
- You have completed a testing phase and need to ensure that previous data does not interfere with new experiments.
