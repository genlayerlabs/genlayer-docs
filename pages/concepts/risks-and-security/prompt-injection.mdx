# Prompt Injection

Prompt Injection is a type of attack where malicious actors craft inputs or "prompts" that are designed to manipulate the behavior of AI models. By carefully formulating these prompts, attackers can trick the AI into performing unintended actions or producing outcomes that compromise the security or functionality of Intelligent Contracts.

Preventing prompt injection is vital for ensuring that Intelligent Contracts operate as intended without interference or manipulation. By securing the inputs and behavior of AI models, GenLayer protects the integrity of its platform and the transactions processed within it, providing a reliable and secure environment for all users.

## How Prompt Injection Occurs

Prompt injection can happen in several ways within GenLayer:

1. **Direct Input Manipulation**: Attackers may directly provide misleading or specially crafted inputs that are designed to be misinterpreted by the AI, leading to erroneous or harmful actions.

2. **Exploiting Model Biases**: LLMs may have inherent biases or vulnerabilities due to their training data. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to influence the model's responses in predictable but unintended ways.

3. **External Data Manipulation**: Since Intelligent Contracts on GenLayer can interact with external web data, there is a risk that compromised or maliciously crafted web content could be used to influence AI behavior by feeding it deceptive information.

## Mitigating Prompt Injection

To counteract the risks associated with prompt injection, GenLayer employs several robust security measures:

- **Rigorous Input Sanitization**: All inputs to LLMs are thoroughly checked and sanitized to strip out potentially malicious elements before they are processed by the AI. This helps prevent harmful or manipulative code from reaching the model.

- **Secure Model Training**: AI models in GenLayer are trained with an emphasis on recognizing and resisting manipulative prompts. This includes using diverse and extensive datasets to reduce model biases and increase resilience against unexpected inputs.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Updates**: GenLayer continuously monitors the behavior of deployed AI models and updates their training and operational parameters to address new threats and vulnerabilities as they are identified.

- **Trusted Data Sources**: When Intelligent Contracts fetch data from the web, GenLayer ensures that only trusted and verified sources are used. This minimizes the risk of ingesting manipulated data that could lead to prompt injection.
