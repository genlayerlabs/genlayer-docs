# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the simulator, here are some detailed steps to help you resolve common problems:

## Frontend Not Loading Correctly
The frontend may not load correctly due to caching issues or an outdated version of the contract stored in your browser.

### Solution
- **Refresh Frontend:** Simply reload the page in your browser.
- **Clear Cache:** Clear your browser's cache by clicking on the left of your address bar -> Cookies and site data -> Manage on device site data -> Delete localhost.

## Port Conflicts
The simulator may fail to start if some ports required for its operation are already in use by other applications.

**Ports used by the simulator:**
- **Frontend:** 8080
- **Ollama:** 11434
- **JSON-RPC Server:** 4000
- **GenVM:** 6678 

### Solution
1. Identify processes using the required ports. Replace `<PORT_NUMBER>` with the specific port number.
   - **Linux / MacOS:**
     ```bash copy
     lsof -i :<PORT_NUMBER>
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```cmd copy
     netstat -aon | find <PORT_NUMBER>
     ```
2. Use the following command to kill the process using the port. Replace `<PID>` with the Process ID obtained from the previous step.
   - **Linux / MacOS:**
     ```bash copy
     kill -9 <PID>
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```cmd copy
     taskkill /PID <PID> /F
     ```

## Docker not Running
The Genlayer Simulator relies on Docker for managing containers and images. If Docker is not running, the simulator cannot function properly.

### Solution
- Ensure that Docker (or Docker Desktop) is installed on your system. You can check this by running:
  
  ```bash copy
  docker info
  ```
- Restart Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon on your system.

## Display Issues
The code section or other UI elements may not display correctly due to screen size limitations.

### Solution
- Resize your screen to accommodate the UI elements properly. This will help improve the visibility and layout of the simulator.

## Simulator Not Responding or Throwing Errors
The simulator may become unresponsive or throw errors due to various reasons, such as conflicting processes or corrupted containers.

### Solution
You can perform a fresh start by stopping and removing all containers, as well as removing all images. 

**Via Command Line:**
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

**Via Docker Desktop:**
1. Open Docker Desktop and go to the **Containers** section.
3. Select all containers and click **Delete**.
4. Go to the **Images** section.
5. Select all images and click **Delete**.
