# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the simulator, here are some detailed steps to help you resolve common problems:

## Problem: Frontend Not Loading Correctly
**Cause:** The frontend may not load correctly due to caching issues or an outdated version of the contract stored in your browser.

**Solution:**
- **Refresh Frontend:** Simply reload the page in your browser.
- **Clear Cache:** Clear your browser's cache by clicking on the lock icon to the left of your address bar -> Cookies and site data -> Manage -> Remove all local data.

## Problem: Port Conflicts
**Cause:** The simulator may fail to start if some ports required for its operation are already in use by other applications.

**Ports Used:**
- **Frontend:** 8080 (used for the frontend)
- **Ollama:** 11434 (used for Ollama)
- **JSON-RPC Server:** 4000 (used for the JSON-RPC server)
- **GenVM:** 6678 (used for GenVM)

**Solution:**
- **Identify Processes:** Use the appropriate command based on your operating system to identify processes using the required ports. Replace `<PORT_NUMBER>` with the specific port number.
   - **Linux / MacOS:**
     ```bash
     lsof -i :<PORT_NUMBER>
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```cmd
     netstat -aon | findstr :<PORT_NUMBER>
     ```
- **Kill Processes:** Use the following command to kill the process using the port. Replace `<PID>` with the Process ID obtained from the previous step.
   - **Linux / MacOS:**
     ```bash
     kill -9 <PID>
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```cmd
     taskkill /PID <PID> /F
     ```

## Problem: Docker not Running
**Cause:** The Genlayer Simulator relies on Docker for managing containers and images. If Docker is not running, the simulator cannot function properly.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that Docker (or Docker Desktop) is running on your system. You can check this by running:
  ```bash
  docker info
  ```
- If Docker is not running, start Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon on your system.

## Problem: Display Not Correct
**Cause:** The code section or other UI elements may not display correctly due to screen size limitations.

**Solution:**
- Resize your screen to accommodate the UI elements properly. This can help improve the visibility and layout of the simulator.

## Problem: Simulator Not Responding or Throwing Errors
**Cause:** Sometimes, the simulator may become unresponsive or throw errors due to various reasons, such as conflicting processes or corrupted containers.

**Solution:**
- Perform a fresh start by stopping and removing all containers, as well as removing all images:
  ```bash
  docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
  docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
  docker rmi $(docker images -q)
  ```

By following these steps, you can resolve common issues and ensure a smooth experience while working with the GenLayer Simulator.
