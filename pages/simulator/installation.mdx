# Install GenLayer

The GenLayer CLI is used to set up the GenLayer Simulator and, in the future, mainnet and testnet environments.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the GenLayer CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Required to run GenLayer environment. Make sure Docker is not only installed but also actively running and updated to the latest version.

- [Node.js and Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/): Needed for the GenLayer CLI tool. Ensure both are updated to their latest versions to avoid compatibility issues.

## Installation steps

### 1. Install GenLayer CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt. Enter the following command to install the GenLayer CLI on your system:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['npm', 'npx']}>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npm install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npx install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Execute the `init` Command

After installing the CLI, set up your development environment by running:

```bash copy
genlayer init
```
When you type `genlayer init` in your terminal and confirm that you want to proceed, the CLI starts the initialization process. Below is a break down of the process:

#### Select LLM Providers
During the initialization, a prompt appears asking you to select which LLM providers you want to use. These LLM providers are used by validators to process and validate transactions as well as execute intelligent contracts. You can choose from Ollama, OpenAI, and Heurist. You can select one or multiple providers based on your needs and the API keys available to you. Here are the options available:

- **OpenAI**: This is the fastest and most reliable option for running validators. However, it requires an OpenAI API key as it is a paid service. Ensure you have this key before opting for OpenAI to avoid any setup delays.

- **Ollama**: This is a free and open source. Ollama is suitable for those who prefer not to use external services. However, it operates significantly slower on most systems, especially those without an optimized Integrated GPU configuration.

- **Heurist**: This is an experimental service that is currently in the testing phase. While Heurist offers free API credits and can be a cost-effective option, it has been noted to fail approximately 10% of the time. If you choose Heurist, prepare for potential inconsistencies and ensure that it fits your tolerance for risk in testing environments.

#### Download Docker Containers and Configure Components
The GenLayer CLI handles the download and setup of various Docker containers necessary for the environment when you run the genlayer init command. This process configures several system components required for executing and managing intelligent contracts. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the CLI does:

- **GenVM**: Sets up the core virtual machine environment necessary for executing intelligent contracts.

- **WebRequest Service**: Configures the WebRequest service to handle external HTTP requests made by the contracts. This service is crucial for contracts that need to interact with external APIs or services.

- **LLM Providers**:  Sets up the selected LLM providers within Docker containers, ensuring they are ready to assist validators in processing and validating transactions and executing intelligent contracts. For example, selecting Ollama triggers the download of an image that includes the necessary software to run Ollama locally.

- **PostgreSQL**: Initializes the PostgreSQL database system to store transaction records, user accounts, and contract states. The logs indicate that PostgreSQL initializes its database cluster and sets up necessary configurations.

- **JsonRPC**: Establishes the JsonRPC server to handle API calls to and from the intelligent contracts. It manages the creation of databases, tables, and account data, as indicated by logs such as `create_db`, `create_tables`, `create_account`, and `fund_account`.

- **Frontend Interface**: Sets up the frontend interface and provides the local and network addresses http://localhost:8080/ for accessing the GenLayer Simulator's frontend interface. From the Simulator, you can start testing and interacting with your Intelligent Contracts and simulate different scenarios.

### Launching the Simulator with Existing Configuration

Once your environment is set up with genlayer init, you can start the GenLayer Simulator at any time using the existing configuration by executing:

```bash
genlayer up
```
This command allows you to launch the simulator with a previously initialized environment and configuration. You can use the following options to customize the simulator launch:
- `--no-reset-accounts`: Use this option to prevent resetting the database of accounts and transactions. This allows you to continue with the existing data without starting afresh. 

- `--reset-validators`: This option removes all current validators and creates new random ones, useful for testing different validator scenarios in development.
