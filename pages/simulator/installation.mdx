# Install GenLayer

The GenLayer CLI is used to set up the GenLayer Simulator and, in the future, mainnet and testnet environments.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the GenLayer CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Required to run GenLayer environment. Make sure Docker is running and updated to the latest version.

- [Node.js and Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/): Needed for the GenLayer CLI tool. Ensure both are updated to their latest versions to avoid compatibility issues.

## Installation steps

### 1. Install GenLayer CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt. Enter the following command to install the GenLayer CLI globally on your system:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['npm', 'npx']}>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npm install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npx install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Initialize the environment

After installing the CLI, set up your development environment:

```bash copy
genlayer init
```

This command performs the following actions:
- Verifies that Docker is installed.
- Downloads and runs the necessary Docker images.
- Initializes the database and sets up the required tables and accounts.
- Launches the Simulator frontend interface.

After executing the start command, go to http://localhost:8080/. Here, you can interact with your contracts and test various functionalities within the Simulator environment.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout>
  The GenLayer Simulator is installed in your user home folder, making it easily accessible for development and testing purposes.
</Callout>

### 3. Launching the Simulator with Existing Configuration

Once your environment is set up with genlayer init, you can start the GenLayer Simulator at any time using the existing configuration by executing:

```bash
genlayer up
```
This command allows you to launch the simulator with a previously initialized environment and configuration. You can use the following options to customize the simulator launch:
- `--no-reset-accounts`: Use this option to prevent resetting the database of accounts and transactions. This allows you to continue with the existing data without starting afresh.  
- `--reset-validators`: This option removes all current validators and creates new random ones, useful for testing different validator scenarios in development.
