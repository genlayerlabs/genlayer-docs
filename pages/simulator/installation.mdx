# Installation
Follow these detailed steps to set up and start using the simulator for developing and testing Intelligent Contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), as they are required to create the necessary environment for the GenLayer Simulator.

## Installation steps

### Clone the repository

Start by cloning the GenLayer Simulator repository from GitHub to get the latest version of the simulator. Open a terminal window and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator
cd genlayer-simulator
```

### Step 1: Set Up the Docker environment

In the root directory of the cloned repository, execute the following commands:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

### Step 2: Install and configure the GenLayer Simulator

Open a second terminal window for the following setup steps:

#### Install the Ollama model

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama2
```

#### Set Up the virtual environment

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
```

For Windows (cmd):

```cmd
virtualenv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) set PYTHONPATH=%cd%
```

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
virtualenv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) $env:PYTHONPATH = (Get-Location).Path
```

#### Initialize the environment

Execute the demo script to set up an initial state with validators and deploy a sample contract:

```bash
(.venv) python scripts/debug_prototype.py
```

## Set up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory within the cloned repository:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will compile the project and start a development server.
