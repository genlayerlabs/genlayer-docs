# Install GenLayer

The GenLayer CLI provides development environment for interacting with the GenLayer ecosystem, supporting tasks such as account creation, transaction handling, and Intelligent Contract operations. It facilitates operations across different environments including mainnet, testnet, and a local simulator.

## Prerequisites
Before installing GenLayer, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Required to run the simulator environment.
- [Node.js and Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/): Needed for the GenLayer CLI tool.


## Installation steps

### 1. Install GenLayer CLI

GenLayer CLI is the main tool for interacting with the GenLayer ecosystem. Install it via npm:

```bash
npm install genlayer
```

### 2. Initialize the environment

After installing the CLI, set up your development environment:

```bash
genlayer init
```

This command performs several actions:
- Verifies that Docker is installed.
- Downloads and runs the necessary Docker images.
- Initializes the database and sets up the required tables and accounts.
- Launches the simulator and optionally the frontend in your browser.

You'll be notified of the frontend's URL and provided documentation links once the setup completes.

## 3. Start the simulator

To begin using the GenLayer environment and test your Intelligent Contracts, start the simulator with the following command:

```bash
genlayer up
```

This command will start the simulator with a fresh database and account setup. It will also provide the frontend URL.
