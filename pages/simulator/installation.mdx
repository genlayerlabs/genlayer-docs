# Install GenLayer

The GenLayer CLI is used to set up the GenLayer Simulator and, in the future, mainnet and testnet environments.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the GenLayer CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Required to run GenLayer environment.
- [Node.js and Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/): Needed for the GenLayer CLI tool.

## Installation steps

### 1. Install GenLayer CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt. Enter the following command to install the GenLayer CLI globally on your system:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['npm', 'npx']}>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npm install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
 <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npx install -g genlayer
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Initialize the environment

After installing the CLI, set up your development environment:

```bash copy
genlayer init
```

This command performs the following actions:
- Verifies that Docker is installed.
- Downloads and runs the necessary Docker images.
- Initializes the database and sets up the required tables and accounts.
- Launches the frontend interface.

With the frontend URL provided, you can access and start using the GenLayer Simulator.
