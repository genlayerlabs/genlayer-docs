# Installation

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Follow these detailed steps to set up and start using the simulator for developing and testing Intelligent Contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), as they are required to create the necessary environment for the GenLayer Simulator.

## Installation steps

### Clone the repository

Start by cloning the GenLayer Simulator repository from GitHub to get the latest version of the simulator. Open a terminal window and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator
cd genlayer-simulator
```

### Step 1: Set Up the Docker environment

In the root directory of the cloned repository, execute the following commands:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
GENVMOPENAIKEY     = '...' # Replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

<Callout>
   To obtain your `GENVMOPENAIKEY`, visit [OpenAI's API platform](https://openai.com/). You will need to register and create an API key that allows your instance of GenVM to interact with OpenAI services.
</Callout>


### Step 2: Install and configure the GenLayer Simulator

Open a second terminal window for the following setup steps:

#### Install the Ollama model

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama2
```

#### Set up the Python virtual environment

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
```

For Windows (cmd):

```cmd
virtualenv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) set PYTHONPATH=%cd%
```

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
virtualenv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) $env:PYTHONPATH = (Get-Location).Path
```

#### Setup GenVM and run simple contract

Execute the demo script to set up an initial state with validators and deploy a sample contract:

```bash
(.venv) python scripts/debug_prototype.py
```

<Callout>
  If you prefer to run the steps separately instead of using the script above, you can follow the commands written [here](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator?tab=readme-ov-file#seperate-steps).
</Callout>

## Set up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory within the cloned repository:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will compile the project and start the localhost development server.
