# Wizard of Coin Contract

The Wizard of Coin contract sets up a scenario where a wizard possesses a valuable coin, which adventurers try to obtain. The wizard must decide whether to give the coin away based on specific conditions.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the Wizard of Coin contract, you'll need to first initialize the contract state correctly. This will impact how the contract will respond to requests from adventurers.

1. Choose whether the wizard begins with the coin. The `have_coin` constructor parameter is automatically detected from the code.
   - If you set `have_coin` to `True` the wizard starts with the coin.
   - If you set  `have_coin` to `False` the wizard starts without the coin.

2. Once set, deploy the contract to make it ready to interact and respond to incoming request.

## Checking the Contract State

Once the contract is deployed, you can check its state in the **Current Intelligent Contract State** section. This section displays the contract address and the state of the wizard regarding the coin. Use the `get_have_coin()` function to see if the wizard still has the coin. Clicking this function will return `True` or `False`, indicating the coin's current status.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the **Execute Transactions** section. Here, you can call the `ask_for_coin` method and enter the adventurer's request, for example, "Can you please give me the coin?" Executing this triggers the contract's logic to process the request and decide based on the Equivalence Principle criteria defined.

## Analyzing the Contract's Decisions

When the `ask_for_coin` method is executed:

- The LLM processes the adventurer's request.
- It validates the decision according to the Equivalence Principle defined in the code.
- Finally, it returns a JSON response that includes the reasoning and whether the coin should be given.

### Handling Different Scenarios

- **Wizard Has the Coin (`have_coin` is `True`)**: The LLM is guided to not give away the coin, ensuring the wizard retains the coin regardless of the request. The JSON response will reflect this decision, showing reasoning for denying the request.
- **Wizard Does Not Have the Coin (`have_coin` is `False`)**: The wizard starts without the coin and cannot give away what it does not possess. The JSON response will indicate that the wizard cannot give the coin because it does not have it.
