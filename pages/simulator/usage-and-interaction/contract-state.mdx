# Current Intelligent Contract State

Once your Intelligent Contract is deployed, you can check its current state to verify that it has been initialized correctly. This step ensures that the contract's data and variables are set as expected.

## Viewing the Current Intelligent Contract State

After deploying your contract, you will see the **Current Intelligent Contract State** section. This section contains two key elements: the contract address and any getter functions defined in your code.

- **Contract Address:** This is used for interacting with your contract.
- **Getter Functions:** This returns the current state of the specified constructor paramter.

  Getter function names must start with `get_`. If you do not include a getter function in your code, it will not appear in this section.
</Callout>

For example, in the **Wizard of Coin** contract:
- If the constructor parameter `have_coin` was set to `True`, the state method `get_have_coin` will return `True`.
- Conversely, if `have_coin` was set to `False`, `get_have_coin` will return `False`.

The result will show the current state based on the getter function is called. This allows you to verify that the variables in your contract have been initialized correctly.

Next, you can proceed to execute transactions and interact with your deployed contract.
