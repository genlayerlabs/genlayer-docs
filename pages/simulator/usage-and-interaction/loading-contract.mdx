# Load Your Contract

To start using the GenLayer Simulator, you need to load your Intelligent Contract into the simulator. This involves navigating the simulator interface, selecting your contract file, and preparing it for deployment and execution.

## Access your Intelligent Contracts

1. On the left sidebar, click on the **Contracts** icon. This is where you can see the list of your Intelligent Contracts. There are pre-loaded example contracts for you to try out.
