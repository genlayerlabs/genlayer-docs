# Set Constructor Parameters and Deploy

Once you have loaded your Intelligent Contract into the GenLayer Simulator, the next step is to set the constructor parameters and deploy it. The constructor parameters are essential inputs that initialize the state of your contract.

## Setting Constructor Parameters

1. Once you have run your Intelligent Contract, you will see the **Constructor Parameters** section on the left-hand pane. The constructor parameters are usually [detected based on the parameters included in your code](#detecting-constructor-parameters).

2. If you need to adjust your parameters, you can manually input them. Click on the **JSON** button to write raw JSON, or use the provided fields.

## Detecting Constructor Parameters

The GenLayer simulator automatically detects the constructor parameters from your code. It analyzes your `__init__` method to identify the parameters and their types. This automatic detection ensures that you have the correct inputs for initializing your contract. Itâ€™s important to have clear type annotations for each parameter (e.g., `str`, `bool`, `int`, `list`) to enable accurate detection.

## Deploying the Contract

After setting the constructor parameters, click the **Deploy** button to deploy your contract.

Once completed, you will see the current state of your Intelligent Contract displayed.

Next, proceed to execute your transactions and interact with the deployed contract.
