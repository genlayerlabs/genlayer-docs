# Deploying a contract

Deploying an Intelligent Contract to the GenLayer Simulator enables you to test and interact with your contract within a controlled environment. 

## Deployment steps

Follow these steps to deploy your contract within the simulator:

1. In the **Your Contracts** section of the navigation pane, select an existing contract or create a new one by clicking the **+** or upload icon.

2. Modify your contract code in the text editor pane. Use the save functionality to ensure changes are not lost.
3. Provide a JSON object that represents the contractâ€™s initial state. This step is crucial for contracts that require specific variables or settings at the start.

    Example of initial state JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "have_coin": true
    }
    ```
4. **Deploy**: Once the contract is finalized and the initial state is set, in the **Run and Debug** section click the **Deploy Intelligent Contract** button to compile and deploy your contract to the GenLayer simulator's blockchain.

The simulator will automatically compile your contract if necessary and a deployment transaction is sent to the blockchain. The UI will display the transaction ID, indicating the deployment status. 

After deployment, your contract is now an active participant on the blockchain:

- Note down the contract's address; it's a unique identifier for interacting with the contract henceforth.
- In the **Current Intelligent Contract State** section, check to see if the initial state reflects the JSON parameters you provided.
- You can now start interacting with the contract, calling its functions, and executing transactions.

## Best practices

- Pay attention to the logs output during the deployment for any execution notes or errors.
- Use the contract state viewer to ensure state changes occur as expected with each transaction.

## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter errors during deployment:

- Review the logs for detailed error messages.
- If the contract state does not update correctly, double-check the JSON format and contract constructor for potential mismatches.
- Revisit the code in the contract editor to ensure all functions are correctly defined and that the contract compiles without issues.
