# Deploying a contract

Deploying an Intelligent Contract to the GenLayer Simulator enables you to test and interact with your contract within a controlled environment. 

## Deployment steps

Follow these steps to deploy your contract within the simulator:

1. In the **Your Contracts** section of the navigation pane, select an existing contract or create a new one by clicking the **+** or upload icon.

<Image src="/your-contract.png" alt="Deploy Contract" width={400} height={400} />

2. Modify your contract code in the text editor pane.
3. Provide a JSON object that represents the contractâ€™s default state. This step is crucial for contracts that require specific variables or settings at the start.

    Example of default state JSON:
    ```json
    {
        "have_coin": true
    }
    ```
4. Once the contract is finalized and the default state is set, in the **Run and Debug** section click the **Deploy Intelligent Contract** button to deploy your contract to the GenLayer simulator's blockchain.

The UI will display the transaction ID, indicating the deployment status. 

After deployment, your contract is now an active participant on the blockchain:

- Note down the contract's address; it's a unique identifier for interacting with the contract henceforth.
- In the **Current Intelligent Contract State** section, check to see if the default state reflects the JSON parameters you provided.
- You can now start interacting with the contract, calling its functions, and executing transactions.

## Best practices

Pay attention to the logs output during the deployment for any execution notes or errors.

## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter errors during deployment:

- Review the logs for detailed error messages.
- If the contract state does not update correctly, double-check the JSON format and contract constructor for potential mismatches.
- Revisit the code in the contract editor to ensure all functions are correctly defined and that the contract compiles without issues.
