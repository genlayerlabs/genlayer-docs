# Deploying a Contract

By deploying your Intelligent Contract to the GenLayer Simulator, you can test and interact with your contract within a controlled environment.

## Deployment Steps

To deploy your contract within the simulator, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Your Contracts** section of the navigation pane. Here, you can select an existing contract or create a new one by clicking the **+** or upload icon.

<Image src="/your-contract.png" alt="Deploy Contract" width={400} height={400} />
  

2. Enter the contract code in the text editor pane provided within the simulator.

3. Set the contract's constructor parameters by providing a JSON object in the **Constructor Parameters** input area. These parameters initialize the contract's variables or settings upon deployment.

   Example JSON object for constructor parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "have_coin": true
   }
   ```

Ensure that the keys in the JSON object match the variables expected by the contract's constructor.

4. After you've set the constructor parameters and the contract code is ready, go to the **Run and Debug** section and click the **Deploy Intelligent Contract** button. This action will deploy your contract to the simulated blockchain environment of the GenLayer Simulator.

Upon successful deployment, the UI will display the contract address.  In the **Current Intelligent Contract State** section, check to see if the default state reflects the JSON parameters you provided.

With the contract now deployed, you are ready to invoke its functions and execute transactions as part of your testing process.

## Best Practices

Keep an eye on the logs logs output during the deployment for any execution notes or errors. If you run into issues during the deployment, review the logs for detailed error messages.
