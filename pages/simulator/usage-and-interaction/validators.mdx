# Accessing and Configuring Validators

Validators in the GenLayer Simulator are critical components responsible for ensuring consensus and validating transactions within the network. When you initialize the simulator based on your selected LLM provider, you are provided with 5 default validators. You can view, modify, or delete these validators as needed to suit your Intelligent Contract's requirements.

## Accessing Validators

To access and manage validators, follow these steps:

1. On the left sidebar, click on the **Settings** icon. This will open the settings menu where you can configure various aspects of the GenLayer Simulator.

2. In the settings menu, you will see the **Validators Configuration** section. This section lists all the validators currently configured in the simulator along with their models and providers.
