# Initiating Transactions

Once your Intelligent Contract is deployed in the GenLayer Simulator, you can start testing how your contract responds to different inputs and state changes, simulating real-world interactions.

## How to initiate a transaction

To initiate a transaction:

1. In the **Execute transactions** section, select the contract method you wish to execute from the drop-down

3. If the method requires arguments, input the necessary parameters in the appropriate format. For methods that change the contract's state, make sure to enter values that are valid according to your contract's logic.

4. Click on the **Execute(method.name)** button to send your request to the simulator. This will invoke the selected contract method with the provided arguments.

## Inspect contract state

Monitor the logs at the bottom of the screen for transaction receipts and any output returned by the contract method, including events emitted or state changes made.
