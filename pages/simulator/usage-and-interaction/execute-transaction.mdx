i/# Execute Transactions

After deploying your Intelligent Contract and verifying its state, the next step is to execute transactions. This allows you to interact with your contract's methods and functions to perform specific actions or queries.

## Executing Transactions

1. In the **Execute Transactions** section, you will see a dropdown menu under **Select a method**. This dropdown lists all the methods available in your Intelligent Contract.

2. Select the method you want to execute from the dropdown menu. For example, in the **Wizard of Coin** contract, select the `ask_for_coin` method.

3. If the method requires input parameters, a field will appear for you to enter the necessary values. For example, the `ask_for_coin` method requires a request string.

4. After entering any required parameters, click the button to execute the method. The simulator will process the transaction and return the result.

## Viewing Transaction Results

Once you execute a transaction, your transaction is will asynchronously progress through various states until it is finalized by the consensus mechanism. This ensures that all nodes in the network have a consistent view of the transaction status.
For example, after initiating the `ask_for_coin` method, you might see the transaction states such as "Pending", "Committing", and "Finalized" as shown below:

You can continue interacting with your Intelligent Contract by executing additional transactions or checking the state again to see how it has changed.

Once finalized the result will be displayed, showing the output of the method called. This allows you to verify that the method has executed correctly and to see the effect of the transaction on your contract's state.

## Viewing Current Account Address

You can also view your current account address in the **Execute Transactions** section. This address is used to interact with your contract and is displayed under **Current Account**.
