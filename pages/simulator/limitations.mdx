# Limitations of the GenLayer Simulator

The GenLayer Simulator is a valuable tool for developers, offering a controlled environment to experiment with Intelligent Contracts. Its features, like web browsing, rapid prototyping, and streamlined debugging/testing, empower developers. However, it does have some limitations.

## Contract-to-Contract Interactions
As of now, the GenLayer Simulator does not enable interactions between different contracts. This means that each contract operates in isolation without the ability to call functions or access data from other contracts.

## Token Transfers
Token transfers between addresses are not supported in the simulator. Developers cannot experiment with token issuance, transfers, or governance mechanisms within the simulator environment.

## Gas Usage
Transactions within the simulator do not consume gas. While beneficial for rapid prototyping, the absence of gas simulation may result in behavior differing from live blockchain networks.
