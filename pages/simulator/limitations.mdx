# Limitations of the GenLayer Simulator

The GenLayer Simulator offers developers a controlled environment to explore the GenLayer platform and experiment with Intelligent Contracts. While it provides numerous benefits like web browsing, faster prototyping and debugging/testing, it has some certain limitations.

## Contract-to-Contract Interactions
As of now, the GenLayer Simulator does not facilitate interactions between different contracts. This means that each contract operates in isolation without the ability to call functions or access data from other contracts.

## Token Transfers
Token transfers between addresses are not supported in the simulator, limiting simulation of token-based transactions. Developers cannot experiment with token issuance, transfers, or governance mechanisms within the simulator environment.

## Gas Usage
Transactions within the simulator do not consume gas, simplifying testing processes and removing the need to manage gas fees. While beneficial for rapid prototyping, the absence of gas simulation may result in behavior differing from live blockchain networks.
