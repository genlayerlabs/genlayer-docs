## Intelligent Contract Syntax in GenLayer

Intelligent Contracts extend traditional smart contract capabilities by processing natural language instructions and interfacing with web data. These contracts are written in Python and executed within the GenVM, a specialized virtual environment.

### Structure of an Intelligent Contract

An Intelligent Contract is defined as a Python class, with properties representing its state and methods that can be invoked to perform actions or respond to queries.

When working with Intelligent Contracts, you start first by importing the Python’s built-in `json` library. The `json` library is essential for several tasks:

- Parsing JSON responses from web APIs or LLM calls.
- Structuring data to send to web services or as inputs to LLMs.
- Serializing state changes in the contract to JSON format for logging or messaging.

Along with the `json` module, we import `icontract` from GenLayer’s contract base module. This import provides the necessary foundation to create an Intelligent Contract.

```python
import json
from genvm.contracts.base import icontract
```

### Defining the Contract

The `@icontract` decorator is used to designate a Python class as an Intelligent Contract. Within the class, you define:

- **State Variables**: Properties that hold the contract's current state.
- **Constructor (`__init__`)**: A method to set initial state conditions based on parameters.
- **Methods**: Functions that define the contract's behavior and can be invoked through transactions.

```python
import json
from genvm.contracts.base import icontract
@icontract
class ExampleContract:
    # State variables represent the current state of the contract
    description: str = "This is an example contract."
    
    # The constructor sets up the initial state using the given parameters
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state_variable = initial_state
    
    # Methods define contract behavior and interaction with the blockchain
    async def example_method(self, parameter):
        # Example of an asynchronous method
        pass
```

### Asynchronous Operations and LLM Calls

Intelligent Contracts can perform asynchronous operations, which is defined with `async def` syntax. This is crucial when interacting with LLMs or making web requests, as these operations are inherently non-blocking and can take time to complete.

Prompts for the LLM is crafted using string formatting. This prompt is essential for interacting with the LLM and influencing its response, which in turn affects the contract's behavior.

```python
async def interact_with_user(self, user_address: str, user_request: str) -> None:
    # Here we simulate a structured prompt for an LLM
    prompt = (
        f"{self.description}\n"
        f"User: {user_request}\n"
        f"Have item: {self.have_item}\n"
    )
    # Additional logic to interact with LLM and process response goes here

```

### State Management and Persistence

The state within the contract is represented by variables and can be modified through the methods. Any change in the state variables reflects on the blockchain.
```python
self.state_variable1 = new_value
```

### The Equivalence Principle

The Equivalence Principle is a fundamental concept in Intelligent Contracts, allowing for consensus among validators on non-deterministic outputs. When non-deterministic operations occur, like those involving an LLM, the Equivalence Principle is applied to validate the consistency of responses. 

Intelligent Contracts must include logic to determine if varying results from different validators are equivalent, maintaining consensus.

```python
# Equivalence check within a method
async with Equivalence Principle(self, final_result, "The result must be consistent") as eq:
    result = await eq.call_llm(prompt)
    # Checking for equivalence in LLM responses
```

### State Updates and JSON Handling

Within an Intelligent Contract, you often need to update the state based on external information. The `json` library is utilized to parse the structured JSON responses from LLMs into Python data types for further processing.

```python
result_json = json.loads(final_result)
if not result_json['desired_outcome']:
    self.state_variable = result_json['data_updates']['new_value']
```

### Returning the Result

Finally, methods can return information, such as a JSON response, which can be read by other contracts or off-chain systems.

```python
return result_json
```
