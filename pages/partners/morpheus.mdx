# Morpheus

[Morpheus](https://mor.org/) is a decentralized AI inference network where open-source model providers compete on a peer-to-peer marketplace. Instead of relying on a single centralized API, Morpheus routes requests across independent compute providers offering models like DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen, and others — with the available model list updating dynamically as providers join and leave the network.

In partnership with GenLayer, Morpheus provides decentralized LLM inference for Intelligent Contract validators through an OpenAI-compatible API. GenLayer Studio fetches available models from the Morpheus marketplace in real time, so validators always see the latest options. Developers can obtain a [Morpheus API key](https://mor.org/) to get started.

This partnership brings decentralized, censorship-resistant AI inference to the GenLayer ecosystem, ensuring that Intelligent Contracts are not dependent on any single provider.
