# Heurist

[Heurist](thttps://www.heurist.ai/) is a Layer 2 network for AI model hosting and inference, built on the ZK Stack. It offers serverless access to open-source AI models through a decentralized network, making AI deployment easy and efficient for developers. This approach promotes transparency and reduces bias, which is especially useful for projects like GenLayer that require detailed AI analysis.

In collaboration with GenLayer, Heurist provides APIs for open-source large language models (LLMs) to enable developers building Intelligent Contracts use AI at low or no cost. Developers building on GenLayer can obtain free [Heurist API credits](https://dev-api-form.heurist.ai) by using the referral code: _"genlayer"_.

This partnership underscores our commitment to providing robust tools and scalable solutions for decentralized applications.
