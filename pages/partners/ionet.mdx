# io.net

io.intelligence is an AI infrastructure and API platform that democratizes access to advanced AI models and AI agents for the IO community and AI developers. It allows users to access and integrate pre-trained open-source models and custom AI agents into their applications via API calls. io.intelligence is powered by [io.net](https://io.net)'s decentralized distributed compute network.

In partnership with GenLayer, [io.net](https://io.net) provides access to over 25 of the top open source models including latest versions of Deepseek, Qwen, Llama and Mistral through one unified API endpoint. Developers on Genlayer can receive free daily compute tokens to access io.intelligence for Enterprise. Complete a short [form](https://form.typeform.com/to/pDmCCViV) to get started.
