# Comput3

[Comput3](https://genlayer.comput3.ai/) is a decentralized compute network providing access to various AI models. The platform offers serverless access to open-source AI models through a distributed infrastructure, enabling developers to leverage powerful AI capabilities without the need for local hardware.

In partnership with GenLayer, Comput3 provides access to inferencing APIs with support for llama3, hermes3, and qwen3 models. GenLayer Validators can use the Comput3.ai inferencing API to power their Intelligent Contracts with high-quality AI responses. Validators can obtain free [Comput3 API credits](https://genlayer.comput3.ai/) to get started with their validator setup.

This partnership enhances the GenLayer ecosystem by providing reliable and scalable AI inference capabilities for decentralized applications.
