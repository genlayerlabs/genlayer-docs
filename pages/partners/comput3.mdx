# Comput3

[Comput3.ai](https://linktr.ee/COMPUT3) is building the GPU backbone for the next wave of decentralized AI. As the landscapes of AI and Web3 continue to evolve, it is being recognized that scalable compute is essential for meaningful innovation. Through Comput3, ultra-cheap, on-demand GPU access is being made available, from h200's to 4090s. The foundation is being laid to support training, inference, and autonomous agents at scale, enabling permissionless and programmable compute for the broader ecosystem.

Comput3 allows you to train models on h200's for $2.00 an hour, no contracts and commitments required.

## Comput3 x GenLayer

As part of that mission, a new layer of compute access is being introduced through the partnership with GenLayer. Comput3 is now serving as an official model provider for GenLayer Validators, enabling real-time inference on open-source models through the Comput3 API. 

### How to use Comput3 in a Validator

GenLayer Validators can use the [Comput3.ai](https://comput3.ai/) inferencing API with access to llama3, hermes3 and qwen3 models.

Validators can obtain free [Comput3 API credits](https://genlayer.comput3.ai/) to get started with their validator setup. Hands-on support is offered through [Comput3 Discord](https://genlayer.comput3.ai/).
