# UserStorage Contract

The UserStorage contract sets up a scenario to store and retrieve string values associated with different user accounts. This contract demonstrates basic per-user data storage and retrieval functionality within a blockchain environment.

```python
# { "Depends": "py-genlayer:test" }

from genlayer import *


@gl.contract
class UserStorage:
    storage: TreeMap[Address, str]

    # constructor
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # read methods must be annotated
    @gl.public.view
    def get_complete_storage(self) -> dict[str, str]:
        return {k.as_hex: v for k, v in self.storage.items()}

    @gl.public.view
    def get_account_storage(self, account_address: str) -> str:
        return self.storage[Address(account_address)]

    @gl.public.write
    def update_storage(self, new_storage: str) -> None:
        self.storage[gl.message.sender_account] = new_storage
```
## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `UserStorage` class initializes the contract with an empty dictionary `self.storage` to store user-specific data.
- **Read Methods**:
  - `get_complete_storage()` returns the entire storage dictionary, containing all user data.
  - `get_account_storage(account_address)` returns the stored value for a specific user account.
- **Write Method**: `update_storage(new_storage)` allows updating the stored value for the user who called the contract (identified by `contract_runner.from_address`).

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the UserStorage contract, you don't need to provide any initial parameters:

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Simply deploy the contract to make it ready for interaction.

## Checking the Contract State

After deploying the contract, its address is displayed and you can check its state in the **Read Methods** section.

- Use `get_complete_storage()` to see all stored user data.
- Use `get_account_storage(account_address)` to see the data for a specific user account.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the **Write Methods** section. Here, you can call the `update_storage` method to change the stored value for the calling user. This triggers the contract's logic to update the storage with the new value.

## Analyzing the Contract's Behavior

When the `update_storage` method is executed:

- The contract updates the `self.storage` dictionary, associating the new value with the address of the user who called the function (`contract_runner.from_address`).
- You can then use the `get_account_storage()` or `get_complete_storage()` methods to verify that the value has been updated for the specific user.

## Handling Different Scenarios

- **Initial State**: When the contract is first deployed, the storage is empty. `get_complete_storage()` will return an empty dictionary.
- **First Update for a User**: When a user first calls `update_storage`, a new entry is created in the storage dictionary for that user's address.
- **Subsequent Updates**: If a user calls `update_storage` again, their existing entry in the storage is updated with the new value.
- **Multiple Users**: Different users can store and retrieve their own values independently.
- **Accessing Non-existent Data**: If `get_account_storage()` is called with an address that hasn't stored any data yet, it will raise a `KeyError`.

You can view the logs to see detailed information about the contract interaction, including the values being stored and retrieved for different user accounts.

This UserStorage contract provides a simple example of how user-specific data can be stored and retrieved on a blockchain, demonstrating basic multi-user state management within a smart contract.
