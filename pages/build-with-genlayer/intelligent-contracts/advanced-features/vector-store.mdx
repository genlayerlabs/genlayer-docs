# Vector Store
The Vector Store feature in GenLayer allows developers to enhance their Intelligent Contracts by efficiently storing, retrieving, and calculating similarities between texts using vector embeddings. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that require natural language processing (NLP), such as creating context-aware applications or indexing text data for semantic search.

## Key Features of Vector Store
The Vector Store provides several powerful features for managing text data:

#### 1. Text Embedding Storage
You can store text data as vector embeddings, which are mathematical representations of the text, allowing for efficient similarity comparisons. Each stored text is associated with a vector and metadata.

#### 2. Similarity Calculation
The Vector Store allows you to calculate the similarity between a given text and stored vectors using cosine similarity. This is useful for finding the most semantically similar texts, enabling applications like recommendation systems or text-based search.

#### 3. Metadata Management
Along with the text and vectors, you can store additional metadata (any data type) associated with each text entry. This allows developers to link additional information (e.g., IDs or tags) to the text for retrieval.

#### 4. CRUD Operations
The Vector Store provides standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing developers to add, update, retrieve, and delete text and vector entries efficiently.

## How to Use Vector Store in Your Contracts
To use the Vector Store in your Intelligent Contracts, you will interact with its methods to add and retrieve text data, calculate similarities, and manage vector storage. Below are the details of how to use this feature.

#### Importing Vector Store
First, import the VectorStore class from the standard library in your contract:

```python
from backend.node.genvm.std.vector_store import VectorStore
```

#### Creating a Contract with Vector Store
Hereâ€™s an example of a contract using the Vector Store for indexing and searching text logs:

```python
# {
#   "Seq": [
#     { "Depends": "py-lib-genlayermodelwrappers:test" },
#     { "Depends": "py-genlayer:test" }
#   ]
# }

from genlayer import *
import genlayermodelwrappers
import numpy as np
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class StoreValue:
    log_id: u256
    text: str


# contract class
@gl.contract
class LogIndexer:
    vector_store: VecDB[np.float32, typing.Literal[384], StoreValue]

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_embedding_generator(self):
        return genlayermodelwrappers.SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

    def get_embedding(
        self, txt: str
    ) -> np.ndarray[tuple[typing.Literal[384]], np.dtypes.Float32DType]:
        return self.get_embedding_generator()(txt)

    @gl.public.view
    def get_closest_vector(self, text: str) -> dict | None:
        emb = self.get_embedding(text)
        result = list(self.vector_store.knn(emb, 1))
        if len(result) == 0:
            return None
        result = result[0]
        return {
            "vector": list(str(x) for x in result.key),
            "similarity": str(1 - result.distance),
            "id": result.value.log_id,
            "text": result.value.text,
        }

    @gl.public.write
    def add_log(self, log: str, log_id: int) -> None:
        emb = self.get_embedding(log)
        self.vector_store.insert(emb, StoreValue(text=log, log_id=u256(log_id)))

    @gl.public.write
    def update_log(self, log_id: int, log: str) -> None:
        emb = self.get_embedding(log)
        for elem in self.vector_store.knn(emb, 2):
            if elem.value.text == log:
                elem.value.log_id = u256(log_id)

    @gl.public.write
    def remove_log(self, id: int) -> None:
        for el in self.vector_store:
            if el.value.log_id == id:
                el.remove()

```
