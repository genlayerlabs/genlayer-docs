# What are Intelligent Contracts?

If you combine Smart Contracts and LLMs you get GenLayer’s Intelligent Contracts. Intelligent Contracts can do anything a smart contract can, such as executing simple transactions once certain conditions are met at the same time have the capacities to process natural language instructions and analyzing information from the World Wide Web.

## Difference Between Smart Contracts and Intelligent Contracts

Below are the differences between traditional smart contracts and intelligent contracts

### Natural Language Processing

- **Smart Contracts:** Traditional smart contracts are limited to executing strictly defined, code-based instructions.

- **Intelligent Contracts:** GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts leverage AI to understand and process natural language, enabling users to interact with the blockchain in more intuitive and accessible ways.

### Internet/Web Access

- **Smart Contracts:** Traditional smart contracts cannot directly access or interact with web data and rely on intermediaries called oracles.

- **Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent Contracts interact directly with the web, allowing for real-time data fetching and interaction without the need for oracles.

### Language and Development

- **Smart Contracts:** Typically developed using specialized blockchain programming languages like Solidity.

- **Intelligent Contracts:** GenLayer allows Intelligent Contracts to be written in Python, broadening accessibility to a wider range of developers.

### Data Interaction and Adaptability

- **Smart Contracts:** Interaction is restricted to on-chain data, making them inherently static.

- **Intelligent Contracts:** Capable of utilizing real-time data, Intelligent Contracts are dynamic, adapting their operations based on current data inputs.

### Consensus and Security

- **Smart Contracts:** Depend on traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.

- **Intelligent Contracts:** Utilize GenLayer's unique **Optimistic Democracy** mechanism, which is used for managing the non-deterministic outputs of Intelligent Contracts. Within this consensus method, a minimum of 5 validators vote by majority decision on whether a transaction gets approved or not. This makes the LLMs far less vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Adversarial inputs are maliciously crafted prompts designed to manipulate the LLM into producing unintended or harmful outputs.

### Use Cases

- **Smart Contracts:** Mainly used for straightforward transactional operations within the blockchain environment.

- **Intelligent Contracts:** Enable a broader range of applications, such as dynamic data feeds, complex decision-making processes, and highly interactive decentralized applications, which respond to real-world data inputs.
