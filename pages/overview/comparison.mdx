# What are Intelligent Contracts?

Intelligent Contracts are an advanced form of smart contracts that can access real-time web data and use AI to understand and carry out natural language commands. These contracts enhance traditional smart contracts by enabling dynamic responses to changes in external data and adaptive functionality that allows them to modify operations as new information becomes available.

## Difference Between Smart Contracts and Intelligent Contracts

| Feature                        | Smart Contracts                                         | Intelligent Contracts                                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                 | Automatically executed contracts with fixed code          | AI-enhanced contracts that process natural language |
| **Capabilities**               | Limited to predefined blockchain actions                 | Can perform complex actions using real-time web data and language understanding |
| **Language Understanding**     | Only execute code-specific commands                      | Capable of interpreting and acting on natural language |
| **Web Data Access**            | Depend on external services (oracles) for web data       | Direct access to web data without intermediaries       |
| **Interaction with Data**      | Interaction limited to data within the blockchain        | Engages directly with data from the internet           |
| **Programming Language**       | Typically use niche languages like Solidity               | Uses more familiar languages like Python               |
| **Ease of Development**        | Complex due to the need for blockchain-specific knowledge | Easier and more accessible for a wider range of developers |
| **Data Handling**              | Need third-party services to fetch web data               | Directly fetches and utilizes web data                 |
| **Flexibility**                | Static operations based on unchanging conditions          | Adapts and responds to real-time data dynamically      |
| **Consensus Mechanism**        | Standard blockchain consensus methods                     | Uses "Optimistic Democracy" for more reliable outcomes |
| **Use Cases**                  | Generally limited to predefined scenarios like payments and apps | Supports dynamic applications like smart oracles, interactive games, and AI-driven decentralized organizations |

These distinctions highlight how GenLayerâ€™s Intelligent Contracts offer significant advantages over traditional smart contracts, enabling more complex, responsive, and secure blockchain applications.
