# What are Intelligent Contracts?

Intelligent Contracts are an advanced form of smart contracts that can access real-time data from the web and leverage AI to process natural language instructions. They extend the capabilities of traditional smart contracts by enabling dynamic behavior, such as real-time responses to external data changes, and adaptive functionality, allowing them to adjust their operations based on new information.

## Difference Between Smart Contracts and Intelligent Contracts

| Feature                        | Smart Contracts                                         | Intelligent Contracts                                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                 | Self-executing with code-based terms                    | AI-integrated with natural language processing         |
| **Capabilities**               | Predefined actions within blockchain                    | Complex actions with real-time data and NLP            |
| **Natural Language Processing**| Limited to code-based instructions                      | Understands and processes natural language             |
| **Internet/Web Access**        | Requires oracles for external data                      | Directly interacts with internet data                  |
| **Interaction**                | Limited to on-chain data, requires oracles              | Direct interaction with real-time internet data        |
| **Development Language**       | Specialized (e.g., Solidity)                            | Python                                                 |
| **Development Complexity**     | High due to specialized knowledge requirements          | Lower, accessible to a broader range of developers     |
| **Data Interaction**           | Requires external oracles                               | Natively interacts with internet data                  |
| **Adaptability**               | Static, predefined conditions                           | Dynamic, responsive to real-time data                  |
| **Consensus Mechanism**        | Relies on underlying blockchain protocols               | Unique "Optimistic Democracy"                          |
| **Use Cases**                  | Limited by external data requirements e.g., financial transactions, automated payments, DApps | Autonomous decision-making, adaptive contract execution, e.g., programmable oracles, decentralized games, AI DAOs |

These distinctions highlight how GenLayerâ€™s Intelligent Contracts offer significant advantages over traditional smart contracts, enabling more complex, responsive, and secure blockchain applications.
