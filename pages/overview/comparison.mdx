# What Makes GenLayer Different

Unlike traditional blockchain platforms that rely solely on smart contracts, GenLayer introduces Intelligent Contracts. These advanced contracts leverage AI to process natural language and interact directly with real-time internet data. This unique capability opens up a vast array of new applications and functionalities that were previously unattainable with standard smart contracts.

## Key Differences Between Smart Contracts and Intelligent Contracts

### Natural Language Processing

**Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are limited to code-based instructions, requiring specific programming knowledge to create and modify contracts. This makes them less accessible to non-technical users.

**Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent contracts utilize AI to understand and process natural language. This allows users to create and interact with contracts using everyday language, making the development and execution of contracts more accessible and intuitive.

### Internet/Web Access

**Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts cannot directly access or interact with internet data. They rely on oracles to fetch external data, which can add latency and potential points of failure.

**Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent contracts directly interact with internet data, allowing real-time updates and decisions based on current events. This capability transforms static contracts into dynamic, web-aware entities.

### Language and Development

**Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are typically written in specialized programming languages such as Solidity for Ethereum. This requirement can be a barrier for some developers due to the need for specific technical knowledge.

**Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent contracts are written in Python, a widely-used and accessible programming language. This makes it easier for a broader range of developers to create and deploy contracts, reducing the complexity of development.

### Data Interaction and Adaptability

**Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are limited to on-chain data and require oracles to interact with external data sources. This can introduce delays and additional costs. They are static in nature, only reacting to predefined conditions.

**Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent contracts are capable of accessing and analyzing real-time internet data natively. They are dynamic and responsive to real-time data, allowing for adaptive decision-making and execution.

### Consensus and Security

**Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts typically rely on the underlying blockchain’s consensus protocol, such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. They are secure within the blockchain but can be vulnerable to oracle manipulation or delays.

**Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent contracts use GenLayer’s unique "Optimistic Democracy," combining Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), Optimistic Execution, and Democratic Voting. This approach provides enhanced security through real-time monitoring, staking, slashing, and appeal processes. It reduces dependency on external oracles, minimizing vulnerabilities.

### Use Cases

**Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are restricted by the inability to process real-time external data independently. Common use cases include financial transactions, automated payments, and decentralized applications (DApps).

**Intelligent Contracts:** On the other hand, Intelligent contracts enable can automatically adjust contract terms based on real-time data such as financial market fluctuations, automated payments, decentralized games etc
