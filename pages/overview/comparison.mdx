# What are Intelligent Contracts?

GenLayer’s Intelligent Contracts combine the functionalities of traditional smart contracts with AI capabilities. These contracts can execute transactions based on predefined conditions while also processing natural language instructions and analyzing information from the World Wide Web.

## Difference Between Smart Contracts and Intelligent Contracts

Below are the differences between traditional smart contracts and Intelligent Contracts.

### Natural Language Processing

- **Smart Contracts:** Traditional smart contracts are limited to executing strictly defined, code-based instructions.
- **Intelligent Contracts:** GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts use AI to understand and process natural language, enabling more dynamic interactions with the blockchain.

### Internet/Web Access

- **Smart Contracts:** Traditional smart contracts cannot directly access or interact with web data and rely on intermediaries called oracles.
- **Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent Contracts directly interact with the web, allowing real-time data fetching and interaction without oracles.

### Language and Development

- **Smart Contracts:** Typically developed using specialized blockchain programming languages like Solidity.
- **Intelligent Contracts:** GenLayer allows Intelligent Contracts to be written in Python, making them accessible to a wider range of developers.

### Data Interaction and Adaptability

- **Smart Contracts:** Interaction is restricted to on-chain data, making them inherently static.
- **Intelligent Contracts:** Intelligent Contracts can utilize real-time data, making them dynamic and adaptable based on current data inputs.

### Consensus and Security

- **Smart Contracts:** Depend on traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.
- **Intelligent Contracts:** Use GenLayer's unique **Optimistic Democracy** mechanism to manage the non-deterministic outputs of Intelligent Contracts.

### Use Cases

- **Smart Contracts:** Mainly used for straightforward transactional operations within the blockchain environment.
- **Intelligent Contracts:** Enable a broader range of applications, such as dynamic data feeds, complex decision-making processes, and highly interactive decentralized applications that respond to real-world data inputs.
