# GenLayer Use Cases

By combining AI with the security and transparency of blockchain technology, GenLayer is forging a new path for decentralized applications. The potential applications of GenLayerâ€™s Intelligent Contracts are vast, spanning across different decentralized applications (DApps). 

Below are some use cases for GenLayer

## Programmable Oracles

Intelligent Contracts can directly fetch and process data from the internet, allowing for real-time responsiveness to external events without the need for third-party oracles. For example, in the financial sector, an Intelligent Contract can automatically adjust interest rates or execute stock trades in response to changing market conditions.

## Decentralized Games

In the gaming world, you can use GenLayer to create decentralized games where game narratives and asset management are influenced by player choices and real-world data. This could mean a game where story developments are genuinely dynamic, evolving based on player decisions, or where in-game assets, like rare items, are traded securely and transparently on the blockchain.

## Trustless Knowledge Bases

GenLayer enables the development of trustless platforms for accumulating and verifying information without centralized control. This is ideal for educational platforms where content can be authenticated and shared widely, or for research databases where scientific data can be stored securely and validated through community consensus, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.

## Agentic DAOs

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on GenLayer can operate with a high degree of automation, making decisions based on real-time data and predefined rules with minimal human oversight. This can streamline processes like allocating community resources or making organizational decisions, reducing the need for constant human management and allowing for a more efficient governance model.
