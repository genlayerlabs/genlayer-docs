# GenLayer Use Cases

By combining AI with the security and transparency of blockchain technology, GenLayer is opening new possibilities for decentralized applications. The potential uses of GenLayerâ€™s Intelligent Contracts are extensive, spanning various decentralized applications (DApps).

Below are some examples of how GenLayer can be applied:

## Programmable Oracles

Intelligent Contracts can fetch and process data directly from the internet, enabling real-time responsiveness to external events without the need for third-party oracles. For instance, in the financial sector, an Intelligent Contract can automatically adjust interest rates or execute stock trades based on changing market conditions.

## Decentralized Games

In the gaming industry, GenLayer can be used to create decentralized games where game narratives and asset management are influenced by player choices and real-world data. This allows for games where story developments are genuinely dynamic, evolving based on player decisions, or where in-game assets, such as rare items, are traded securely and transparently on the blockchain.

## Trustless Knowledge Bases

GenLayer supports the development of trustless platforms for accumulating and verifying information without centralized control. This is ideal for educational platforms where content can be authenticated and shared widely or for research databases where scientific data can be securely stored and validated through community consensus, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.

## Agentic DAOs

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on GenLayer can operate with a high degree of automation, making decisions based on real-time data and predefined rules with minimal human oversight. This can streamline processes like allocating community resources or making organizational decisions, reducing the need for constant human management, and allowing for a more efficient governance model.
