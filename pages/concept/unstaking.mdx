# Unstaking in GenLayer

Unstaking in GenLayer is the process by which validators remove their staked tokens from the network, thereby ceasing their role as active validators. The unstaking procedure ensures that validators meet all requirements and resolve any pending obligations before withdrawing their stake. This process is designed to maintain the network's integrity and align the incentives of validators with the security of the platform.

## How Unstaking Works

The unstaking process involves the following steps:

1. **Initiating Unstaking**: The validator submits a transaction to start the unstaking process. This signals their intention to stop validating transactions on the network.

2. **Validator Removal**: After submitting the unstaking request, the validator is removed from the set of active validators. This means they will no longer be assigned new transactions or appeals for validation.

3. **Finality Period**: The validator must wait for the Finality Window to close. This waiting period ensures that any potential violations, such as incorrect validations or missed execution windows, are accounted for before the validator's balance is finalized.

4. **Withdrawing Stake**: After the Finality Window closes and no outstanding issues remain, the validator and their delegators can withdraw their stake. The stake, including any rewards, is then returned to the appropriate accounts.

## Purpose of Unstaking

The unstaking process serves several important purposes:

1. **Ensuring Accountability**: The Finality Window ensures that any outstanding violations or potential appeals are resolved before a validator's stake is returned. This prevents validators from leaving the network without addressing potential issues.

2. **Aligning Incentives**: The waiting period aligns the incentives of validators with the network, ensuring they act honestly and fulfill their responsibilities before unstaking.

3. **Maintaining Security**: By requiring validators to go through an unstaking process, GenLayer ensures that validators cannot easily exit the network without resolving potential security concerns.

## Implications for Validators and Delegators

For validators, the unstaking process means they must plan ahead if they wish to stop validating, as the Finality Window can vary. For delegators, unstaking their tokens requires them to wait for the validator to go through the unstaking process, which protects their interests by ensuring any penalties or rewards are accounted for before withdrawal.
