# Staking in GenLayer

Staking is a fundamental component of the GenLayer network, critical for maintaining its security and operational integrity. Participants, known as validators, commit a specified amount of tokens to the network by locking them up on the rollup layer. This commitment supports the network's consensus mechanism and enables validators to participate in processing transactions and managing the network.

## How Staking Works in GenLayer

### 1. **Stake Deposit**
To become a validator on GenLayer, participants must deposit GEN tokens into a specific smart contract on the rollup layer. This deposit acts as a security bond and qualifies them to join the pool of active validators.

### 2. **Validator Participation**
Once staked, validators can engage in validating transactions and executing Intelligent Contracts. Their role is crucial for ensuring the network’s reliability and consensus on transaction outcomes.

### 3. **Earning Rewards**
Validators receive rewards for their validation efforts, paid in GEN tokens. These rewards are proportional to the amount of tokens they have staked and the transaction volume they help process.

### 4. **Risk of Slashing**
If a validator acts against the network's rules—such as by attempting to approve fraudulent transactions or failing to remain online—they risk having a portion of their staked tokens slashed as a penalty.

### 5. **Unstaking and Withdrawing**
Validators wishing to cease their validation activities must initiate an unstaking process. This involves a cooldown period to ensure all pending transactions are finalized before the staked tokens can be withdrawn from the rollup layer.

## Importance of Rollup Layer in Staking

Staking tokens on the rollup layer allows GenLayer to leverage the efficiency and scalability of rollups while ensuring the security and decentralization of the network. This architecture helps manage and secure the staking process, providing a robust framework for network operations.

- **Enhanced Security:** Locking tokens on the rollup layer secures them in a dedicated environment, minimizing risks and ensuring that validators have a vested interest in the network’s success.
- **Scalability:** By utilizing rollups, GenLayer can handle more transactions and operations without congesting the main blockchain, allowing for faster processing and reduced transaction costs.
- **Decentralization and Fairness:** The rollup layer ensures that all validators are treated equally, with staked tokens managed transparently and efficiently.
