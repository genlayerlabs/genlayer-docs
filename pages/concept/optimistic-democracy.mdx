# Optimistic Democracy

Optimistic Democracy is the consensus mechanism employed by GenLayer, designed to validate transactions and operations of Intelligent Contracts efficiently. This method is particularly adept at handling non-deterministic outcomes from transactions involving web data or AI models, crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the network.

## Key Components

- **Validators:** Participants who stake tokens to earn the right to validate transactions. They are critical in both the initial validation and the subsequent appeals process, if necessary.
  
- **Leader Selection:** A process that randomly selects one validator to propose the execution outcome for each transaction, ensuring fairness and reducing potential biases.

## How It Works

Optimistic Democracy relies on a balance of trust and verification to ensure the integrity of transactions:

1. **Initial Validation**: When a transaction is submitted, a small subset of randomly selected validators checks its validity. Among them, one is selected as the leader. The leader executes the transaction, and other validators assess the quality of the leader's proposal using the Equivalence Principle.

2. **Affirmative Majority Consensus**: If the leader's proposal is accepted by a majority of validators, the transaction is provisionally accepted. However, this decision is not yet final, allowing for the possibility of appeals during a limited window of time, known as the **[Finality Window](/concept/optimistic-democracy/finality)**.

<Callout>
  If any validator fails to vote within the specified timeframe, they are replaced, and a new validator is selected to cast a vote
</Callout>

3. **Initiating an Appeal**:  If a participant disagrees with a transaction's initial validation(if it's incorrect or fradulent), they can start an appeal to challenge the validation during the Finality Window. To do this, they must submit a request and provide a required bond. After the appeal is initiated, a new group of validators joins the original ones. This combined group first votes on whether the transaction should be re-evaluated. If they agree it should, a new leader is chosen to reassess the transaction, and all validators in the group then review this new evaluation.

4. **Appeal Evaluation**: The new leader re-evaluates the transaction, while the other validators again assess the leader's proposal using the Equivalence Principle. This escalated validation involves a larger number of validators, increasing the chances of an accurate decision.

5. **Escalating Appeals**:  If the appealing party is still unsatisfied, the process can escalate further, with each round involving a larger set of validators. Each round doubles the number of validators. A new leader is only selected if the transaction is overturned

6. **Final Decision**: The appeals process continues until a majority consensus is reached or until all validators have participated. The final decision is then recorded, and the transaction's state is updated accordingly. If the appealing party is correct, they receive a reward for their efforts, while incorrect appellants lose their bond.
