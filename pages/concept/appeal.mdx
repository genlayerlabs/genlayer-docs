# Appeals Process in GenLayer

The appeals process in GenLayer is an essential component of the Optimistic Democracy consensus mechanism. It provides a means for correcting errors or disagreements in the validation of Intelligent Contracts. This process ensures that non-deterministic transactions are accurately evaluated, contributing to the robustness and fairness of the platform.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Validation**: When a transaction is submitted, a small subset of randomly selected validators checks its validity. The transaction is executed by a leader, and other validators assess the quality of the leader's proposal using the Equivalence Principle.

2. **Provisional Acceptance**: If the leader's proposal is accepted by a majority of validators, the transaction is provisionally accepted. However, this decision is not yet final, allowing for the possibility of appeals during a limited window of time, known as the "Finality Window."

3. **Initiating an Appeal**: If any party disagrees with the initial validation, they can initiate an appeal. This involves submitting a request during the Finality Window, along with a bond that demonstrates their commitment to the appeal. The appeal is assigned to a new set of validators, with one of them randomly selected as the leader.

4. **Appeal Evaluation**: The new leader re-evaluates the transaction, while the other validators again assess the leader's proposal using the Equivalence Principle. This escalated validation involves a larger number of validators, increasing the chances of an accurate decision.

5. **Escalating Appeals**: If the appealing party is still unsatisfied, the process can escalate further, with each round involving a larger set of validators. The number of validators doubles with each round, up to the maximum number available. Each round involves a new leader and a new set of validators, enhancing the diversity and thoroughness of the evaluation.

6. **Final Decision**: The appeals process continues until a majority consensus is reached or until all validators have participated. The final decision is then recorded, and the transaction's state is updated accordingly. If the appealing party is correct, they receive a reward for their efforts, while incorrect appellants lose their bond.

## Gas Costs for Appeals

The gas costs for an appeal can be covered by the original user, the appellant, or any third party. When submitting a transaction, users can include an optional tip to cover potential appeal costs. If insufficient gas is provided, the appeal may fail to be processed, but any party can supply additional gas to ensure the appeal proceeds.
