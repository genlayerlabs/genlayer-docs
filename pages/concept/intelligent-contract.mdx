# Intelligent Contracts

An Intelligent Contract is an advanced type of smart contract that retains all the traditional capabilities of smart contracts but also has the ability to process natural language instructions and access data from the web.

## Key features of Intelligent Contract
Here are the key features of Intelligent Contracts:

### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
Intelligent Contracts in GenLayer can interpret and execute instructions written in natural language. This allows it to make complex decisions, use qualitative criteria, and extract information from text. LLMs can handle details and contexts that rigid code cannot, such as conditional reasoning and subjective criteria. This flexibility enables more complex agreements that would be difficult or impossible to code traditionally. Also, NLP by LLMs integrates smoothly with various data sources and services, providing dynamic responses to real-world conditions. This makes Intelligent Contracts adaptable and capable of evolving in response to changing circumstances without requiring manual code updates.

### 2. **Web Interaction**
Unlike traditional smart contracts, which are typically isolated from the internet, Intelligent Contracts on GenLayer can directly interact with web data. This capability allows them to utilize real-time information from various online sources, enhancing their functionality and application scope.

### 3. **Non-Deterministic Operation Handling**
Intelligent Contracts can perform non-deterministic operations. This means they can handle tasks where outputs are not predictable every time, such as those involving AI models or external data queries, and integrate these outputs into the blockchain's deterministic environment.
