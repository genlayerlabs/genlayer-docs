# Intelligent Contracts

An Intelligent Contract is an advanced type of smart contract that retains all the traditional capabilities of smart contracts but also has the ability to process natural language instructions and access data from the web.

## Key features of Intelligent Contract
Here are the key features of Intelligent Contracts:

### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Capabilities**
Intelligent Contracts in GenLayer can interpret and execute instructions written in natural language. This ability makes them significantly more accessible and easier to use compared to traditional smart contracts, which require interactions to be coded in specific programming languages.

### 2. **Web Interaction**
Unlike traditional smart contracts, which are typically isolated from the internet, Intelligent Contracts on GenLayer can directly interact with web data. This capability allows them to utilize real-time information from various online sources, enhancing their functionality and application scope.

### 3. **Non-Deterministic Operation Handling**
Intelligent Contracts can perform non-deterministic operations. This means they can handle tasks where outputs are not predictable every time, such as those involving AI models or external data queries, and integrate these outputs into the blockchain's deterministic environment.

### 4. **Optimistic Democracy Consensus Mechanism**
Intelligent Contracts utilize a specific consensus mechanism called Optimistic Democracy. This allows for efficient processing and validation of contracts through a system where a small subset of validators initially approves transactions, with further validation steps in place for disputes or appeals.
