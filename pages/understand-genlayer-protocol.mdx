## What is GenLayer? 

GenLayer is the first AI-native blockchain purpose-built for AI-powered smart contracts—called Intelligent Contracts—capable of reasoning and adapting to real-world data. Its foundation is the Optimistic Democracy consensus mechanism, an enhanced Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) model where validators connect directly to Large Language Models (LLMs). This setup allows for non-deterministic operations—such as processing text prompts, fetching live web data, and executing AI-based decision-making—while preserving the reliability and security of a traditional blockchain.
