# Security and Best Practices
Security is fundamental to the GenLayer platform, encompassing aspects such as transaction validation, consensus mechanisms, validator behavior, and contract execution.

## Key Components

- **Consensus Security**: The Optimistic Democracy mechanism ensures secure handling of both deterministic and non-deterministic transactions.
- **Validator Behavior**: Validators are incentivized to act honestly through staking and are penalized for malicious behavior via slashing.
- **Contract Security**: Intelligent Contracts must be carefully designed to prevent vulnerabilities such as prompt injection and unauthorized access.

## Security Mechanisms

- **Slashing and Penalties**: Malicious validators can lose their staked tokens if they attempt to manipulate transactions.
- **Appeals Process**: Provides a way to correct incorrect transaction validations and resolve disputes.
- **Equivalence Principle**: Ensures reliable consensus on non-deterministic outputs.

## Best Practices

- **Secure Coding**: Developers should follow best practices in writing contracts, including input validation and error handling.
- **Validator Configuration**: Proper validator setup reduces the risk of misconfiguration and security breaches.
- **Regular Audits**: Continuous review and auditing of contracts and network components enhance security.
