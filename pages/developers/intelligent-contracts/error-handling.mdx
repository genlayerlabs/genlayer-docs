# Error handling

Sometimes contracts can produce errors. There are two kinds of errors in GenVM:

- unrecoverable errors
- rollbacks

If a non-deterministic block or contract call produces an unrecoverable error, it will terminate your contract execution. Unrecoverable errors include:

- `exit(x)` where $x \neq 0$
- unhandled `Exception`

And a recoverable error via one of two mechanisms:

- `raise Rollback("message")`
- `gl.rollback_immediate("message")`

Latter method won't unwind stack and current VM can't catch it.

Built-in `gl.eq_principle_*` functions family will `raise Rollback(sub_vm_message)` in case non-deterministic block agreed on a rollback. Note that rollback message is compared for strict equality.
