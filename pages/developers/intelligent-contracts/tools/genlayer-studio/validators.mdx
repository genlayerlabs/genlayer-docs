# Accessing and Configuring Validators

In the GenLayer Studio, validators are essential for achieving consensus and validating transactions through a process known as [Optimistic Democracy](/core-concepts/optimistic-democracy). When you initialize the Studio based on your selected LLM provider(s), you are provided with 5 default validators.

1. **Leaders:** Within this consensus model, one validator is selected as the leader for each transaction. The leader's role is to propose how a transaction should be executed based on the transaction data and the Intelligent Contract's logic.

2. **Validators:** After the leader proposes a transaction execution, other validators are responsible for reviewing and validating the proposal. They use the [Equivalence Principle](/core-concepts/optimistic-democracy/equivalence-principle) to determine if the leaderâ€™s proposal meets the required standards.

These validators can be modified to suit your Intelligent Contract's requirements.

## Accessing Validators

1. On the left sidebar, click on the **Validators** icon. This will open the validators page.

2. In the validators page, you will see a list with all the validators currently configured in the Studio along with their models and providers.
