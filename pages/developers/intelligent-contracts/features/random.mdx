# Random

Getting random in deterministic part may be difficult. Trying to delegate it to non-deterministic block will cause
your contract to either never agree on that block or to trust the leader. For that reason it is advised to use seeded random.

## Seed acquisition methods

1. Use some field of `message`
2. Use current time (transaction time)
3. Use `stdin`, as shown below

```python3
def get_random_seed() -> bytes:
    import os
    import hashlib
    f = os.fdopen(0, 'rb', buffering=0, closefd=False)
    f.seek(0)
    hash_obj = hashlib.sha256()
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(8192)
        if not chunk:
            return hash_obj.digest()
        hash_obj.update(chunk)
```
