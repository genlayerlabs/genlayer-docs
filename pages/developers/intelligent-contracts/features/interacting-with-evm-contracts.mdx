# Interacting with EVM Contracts

## Contract Interface Definition

Define EVM contract interfaces using decorators:

```python
@gl.evm.contract_interface
class TokenContract:
    class View:
        def balance_of(self, owner: Address) -> u256: ...
        def total_supply(self) -> u256: ...

    class Write:
        def transfer(self, to: Address, amount: u256) -> bool: ...
        def approve(self, spender: Address, amount: u256) -> bool: ...
```

## Calling EVM Contracts

Interact with EVM contracts through defined interfaces:

```python
token_address: Address = ...
# Read from EVM contract
token = TokenContract(token_address)
supply = token.view().total_supply()

# Write to EVM contract
token.emit().transfer(receiver_address, u256(100))
```

## Balance Access

Access EVM contract balances directly:

```python
evm_contract = TokenContract(address)
balance = evm_contract.balance  # Get contract's ETH balance
```

## Message Emission

Send messages to EVM contracts:

```python
TokenContract(token_address).emit().approve(spender, amount)
```
