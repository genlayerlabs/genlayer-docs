# Balances

## Getting Contract Balance

Access your contract's balance using `self.balance` within contract methods:

```python
class Contract(gl.Contract):
    @gl.public.view
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance  # Shows contract's current balance
```

## Getting Another Contract's Balance

Get any contract's balance by address:

```python
other_contract = gl.get_contract_at(contract_address)
print(other_contract.balance)
```

## Transferring Funds

Transfer funds from sender to current contract:

```python
other_contract = gl.get_contract_at(gl.message.sender_address)
other_contract.emit_transfer(value=u256(5))
other_contract.emit(value=u256(5), on='finalized').transfer(Address("0x..."))
```

## Balance Context

Balance behavior depends on execution context:
- In `write` methods: `self.balance` reflects actual contract balance after state changes
- In `view` methods: Balance shows current state without modifications
- Transfers can only occur in write context

<Callout type="warning">
  If message is emitted on acceptance and previous transaction gets successfully appealed after the emit,
  the balance will be decremented nonetheless
</Callout>
