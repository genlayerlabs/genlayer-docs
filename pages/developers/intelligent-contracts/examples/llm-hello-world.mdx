# LlmHelloWorld Contract

The LlmHelloWorld contract demonstrates a simple example of integrating AI capabilities within an intelligent contract. This contract shows how to use the [comparative equivalence principle](/developers/intelligent-contracts/equivalence-principle#comparative-equivalence-principle) to call an LLM and store the response in the contract state.

```python
# { "Depends": "py-genlayer:test" }

from genlayer import *
import typing


class LlmHelloWorld(gl.Contract):
    message: str

    def __init__(self):
        self.message = ""

    @gl.public.write
    def set_message(self) -> typing.Any:

        def get_message() -> str:
            task = "There is no context, I just want you to answer with a string equal to 'yes'"
            result = gl.exec_prompt(task)
            print(result)
            return result

        self.message = gl.eq_principle_strict_eq(get_message)

    @gl.public.view
    def get_message(self) -> str:       
        return self.message
```

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `LlmHelloWorld` class initializes with an empty string in the `message` variable.
- **Write Method**: 
  - `set_message()` uses AI functionality to generate and store a message.
  - It contains an inner function `get_message()` that prompts an AI model with a simple task.
  - Uses `gl.eq_principle_strict_eq()` to ensure deterministic AI responses across the network.
- **Read Method**: 
  - `get_message()` returns the stored message.

## Key Components

1. **AI Integration**: The contract uses `gl.exec_prompt()` to interact with an AI model.
2. **Deterministic Execution**: `gl.eq_principle_strict_eq()` ensures that all nodes in the network arrive at the same exact result.
3. **State Management**: The contract maintains a single string state variable that stores the AI response.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the LlmHelloWorld contract:

1. **Deploy the Contract**: No initial parameters are needed for deployment.
2. The contract will initialize with an empty message.

## Checking the Contract State

After deployment, you can:

- Use `get_message()` to view the currently stored message.
- Initially, this will return an empty string.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract:

1. Call `set_message()` to trigger the AI interaction.
2. The function will:
   - Execute the AI prompt requesting a "yes" response
   - Store the result using the equivalence principle
   - Print the result to the logs

## Understanding AI Integration

This contract demonstrates several important concepts:

- **AI Prompting**: Shows how to formulate simple prompts for AI models within smart contracts.
- **Deterministic AI**: Uses the equivalence principle to ensure all nodes reach consensus on AI outputs.
- **State Updates**: Demonstrates how AI-generated content can be stored in blockchain state.

## Handling Different Scenarios

- **Initial State**: The message starts empty.
- **After set_message()**: The message will contain "yes" (the AI's response).
- **Multiple Calls**: Each call to `set_message()` will update the stored message.
- **Network Consensus**: All nodes will agree on the same message due to the equivalence principle.

## Important Notes

1. This is a minimal example to demonstrate AI-blockchain integration.
2. The AI prompt is intentionally simple for demonstration purposes.
3. The equivalence principle ensures that the AI response is consistent across all network nodes.

You can monitor the contract's behavior through transaction logs, which will show the AI responses and state updates as they occur.
