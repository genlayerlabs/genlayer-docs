# GitBounties Contract

The GitBounties contract sets up a scenario to manage bounties for GitHub issues, allowing developers to claim points for resolving issues. This contract demonstrates more complex interactions involving external data (GitHub) and multi-step processes within a blockchain environment.

            It is mandatory that you respond only using the JSON format above, nothing else.
            Don't include any other words or characters, your output must be only JSON without any

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `GitBounties` class initializes the contract with a GitHub repository, setting up data structures for developers, points, and bounties.
- **Read Methods**:
  - `get_developers()`: Returns the mapping of GitHub usernames to blockchain addresses.
  - `get_points()`: Returns the mapping of GitHub usernames to earned points.
  - `get_bounties()`: Returns the current bounties and their status.
- **Write Methods**:
  - `add_bounty(issue, points)`: Allows the owner to add a new bounty for an issue.
  - `register(github_username)`: Allows developers to register by linking their GitHub profile to their blockchain address.
  - `claim(pull)`: Processes a claim for a resolved issue, awarding points based on the bounty and the number of change requests asked by reviewers.


## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the GitBounties contract, you need to provide the GitHub repository:

1. **Set GitHub Repository**: Provide the GitHub repository in the format "username/repository".
2. **Deploy the Contract**: Once the repository is set, deploy the contract to make it ready for interaction.

## Checking the Contract State

After deploying the contract, its address is displayed and you can check its state in the **Read Methods** section.

- Use `get_developers()` to see registered developers.
- Use `get_points()` to see points earned by developers.
- Use `get_bounties()` to see all current bounties and their status.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the **Write Methods** section. Here, you can:

- Call `add_bounty(issue, points)` to create a new bounty (owner only).
- Call `register(github_username)` for developers to register.
- Call `claim(pull)` to process a claim for a resolved issue.

## Analyzing the Contract's Behavior

The contract's behavior involves several complex interactions:

- **Adding Bounties**: Only the contract owner can add bounties for specific issues.
- **Developer Registration**: Developers must register by providing their GitHub username. The contract verifies that their address has been added to their GitHub profile.
- **Claiming Bounties**: When a developer claims a bounty:
  - The contract fetches the pull request data from GitHub.
  - It verifies if the pull request is merged and identifies the associated issue.
  - It calculates points based on the bounty value and the number of change requests.
  - Points are awarded to the developer who resolved the issue.

## Handling Different Scenarios

- **Successful Claim**: When a valid claim is processed, the bounty is marked as claimed, and points are awarded to the developer.
- **Invalid Claim**: If the pull request is not merged or doesn't reference a valid bounty, the claim is rejected.
- **Point Calculation**: The number of change requests affects the points awarded, with more changes resulting in fewer points.
- **Minimum Points**: A minimum of 1 point is always awarded for a successful claim.

This GitBounties contract demonstrates a complex use case involving external data integration, multi-step verification processes, and dynamic point calculation. It showcases how blockchain contracts can interact with real-world systems to create incentive structures for open-source contributions.
