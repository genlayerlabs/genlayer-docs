# Deploying Intelligent Contracts

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about deploying your Intelligent Contracts on GenLayer. From local development to testnet deployment, learn how to use different methods and networks effectively.

## Quick Start

Get started quickly with these essential deployment options:

## Deployment Approaches

GenLayer offers two primary deployment methods:

### CLI Direct Deployment
Perfect for quick deployments and simple contracts. Deploy with a single command:

```bash
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py --args "Hello World" 42
```

### Deploy Scripts
Ideal for complex workflows, multi-contract deployments, and testnet environments:

```typescript
export default async function main(client: GenLayerClient<any>) {
  // Deploy and configure multiple contracts
  const mainContract = await deployContract(client, "contracts/main.py", []);
  const helperContract = await deployContract(client, "contracts/helper.py", [mainContract]);
  
  await configureContracts(client, mainContract, helperContract);
}
```

## Networks Overview

Deploy to different networks based on your development stage:

| Network | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Localnet** | Local development | Development, debugging, initial testing |
| **Studionet** | Hosted development | Team collaboration, quick prototyping |
| **TestnetAsimov** | Pre-production testing | Final validation (requires faucet tokens) |

## Development Workflow

Follow this recommended progression:

1. **Develop locally** on `localnet` with full control
2. **Test collaboratively** on `studionet` with your team  
3. **Validate thoroughly** on `testnetAsimov` in a production-like environment

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Start with CLI deployment for simple contracts, then graduate to deploy scripts as your projects become more complex.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

After deploying your contracts:

1. **Test Contract Functions**: Use `genlayer call` and `genlayer write` to interact with deployed contracts
2. **Monitor Transactions**: Check transaction receipts with `genlayer receipt <txId>`
3. **Build Frontend**: Integrate with your deployed contracts using [GenLayerJS](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-js)
4. **Debug Issues**: Use the [Debugging Guide](./debugging) if you encounter problems
