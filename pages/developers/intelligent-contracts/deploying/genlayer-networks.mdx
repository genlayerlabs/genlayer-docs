# GenLayer Networks

GenLayer supports three different networks, each serving specific purposes in the development lifecycle:

## Localnet

**Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **When to use**: During development, debugging, and initial testing
- **Setup**: Requires running GenLayer CLI locally with `genlayer init` and `genlayer up`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:4000/api` (default)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Full control over validators and network configuration
  - No external dependencies
  - Fast transaction processing
  - Ability to reset database and validators

### Setting up Localnet

```bash
# Initialize local network
genlayer init

# Start the local network
genlayer up

```

## Studionet

**Purpose**: Hosted development environment
- **When to use**: For development without local setup requirements
- **Setup**: Accessible through [studio.genlayer.com/api](https://studio.genlayer.com)
- **Benefits**:
  - No local installation required
  - Pre-configured validators
  - Shared development environment
  - Ideal for quick prototyping

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  Studionet is perfect for getting started quickly or when you need to share your development environment with others.
</Callout>

### Using Studionet

```bash
# Set network to studionet
genlayer network studionet

# Deploy to studionet
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py
```

## TestnetAsimov

**Purpose**: Production-like testing environment
- **When to use**: For final testing
- **Setup**: Connect using network configuration
- **Benefits**:
  - Production-like environment
  - Stable for testing dApp integrations
  - Shared testnet for community testing

### Using TestnetAsimov

```bash
# Set network to testnet
genlayer network testnet-asimov

# Deploy to testnet
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py
```

## Network Comparison

| Feature | Localnet | Studionet | TestnetAsimov |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Medium | None | Low |
| **Control Level** | Full | Limited | Limited |
| **Persistence** | Local only | Temporary | Persistent |
| **Collaboration** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Performance** | Fast | Medium | Production-like |
| **Best for** | Development | Prototyping | Pre-production testing |

## Development Workflow

We recommend following this progression:

1. **Start with Localnet**: Develop and test your contracts locally with full control
2. **Test on Studionet**: Validate contracts in a shared environment
3. **Deploy to TestnetAsimov**: Final testing in a production-like environment
