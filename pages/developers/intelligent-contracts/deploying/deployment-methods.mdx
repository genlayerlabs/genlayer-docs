# Deployment Methods

GenLayer offers two primary methods for deploying Intelligent Contracts:

1. **CLI Direct Deployment**: Deploy contracts directly using command-line arguments
2. **Deploy Scripts**: Use TypeScript/JavaScript scripts for complex deployment workflows

## CLI Direct Deployment

The CLI method is perfect for:
- Quick deployments during development
- Simple contracts with minimal setup
- Testing and debugging scenarios
- One-off contract deployments

**Benefits:**
- Fast and straightforward
- No additional files required
- Direct command-line interface
- Immediate feedback

## Deploy Scripts

The deploy script method is ideal for:
- Complex deployment workflows
- Multi-contract deployments
- Testnet environments
- Repeatable deployment processes

**Benefits:**
- Version control friendly
- Complex logic support
- Environment-specific configurations
- Error handling and rollback capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Choosing the Right Method

| Scenario | Recommended Method | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Local development | CLI Direct | Quick iteration and testing |
| Single contract | CLI Direct | Simple and efficient |
| Multiple contracts | Deploy Scripts | Better orchestration |
| Testnet deployment | Deploy Scripts | More control and reliability |
| CI/CD integration | Deploy Scripts | Automation friendly |
