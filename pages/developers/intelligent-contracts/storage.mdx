# Persisting data on the blockchain

Usual data structures aren't suitable for representing blockchain persistent storage:

1. Allocated addresses (`id` in python terms) are not persistent
2. Allocation requires knowledge about all allocated addresses, which takes a lot of space and would cost a lot of reads at start time
3. Serialization works poorly as it will rewrite entire storage (consider rehash)

Intelligent Contracts store data publicly on chain, attached to their account's address. The storage starts zero-initialized until a contract is deployed and initializes a state.

For storage declaration GenLayer uses contract class fields.

<Callout emoji="🚫">
    All persistent fields must be declared in the class body and annotated with types.
    <br/>Fields declared outside the class body by creating new instance variables (`self.field = value`) are not persistent and will be discarded after the contract execution.
</Callout>

Example:
```py
class PersistentContract(gl.Contract):
    minter: Address

    def __init__(self):
        self.minter = gl.message.sender_address
```

In your contracts, you can use any Python types, but for persisted fields, there are some restrictions:
- `list[T]` needs to be replaced with `DynArray[T]`
- `dict[K, V]` needs to be replaced with `TreeMap[K, V]`
- `int` type isn't supported on purpose. You most likely wish to use some fixed-size integer type, such as `i32` or `u256`. If this is not the case and you are sure that you need big integers, you can annotate your field with `bigint`, which is just an alias for python `int`

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
    Only fully instantiated generic types can be used, so `TreeMap` is forbidden, while `TreeMap[str, u256]` is not
</Callout>

Simple examples:

```py
class PersistentContract(gl.Contract):
    a: str
    b: bytes
    # c: list[str]           # ❌ `list` is forbidden!
    c: DynArray[str]
    # b: dict[Address, u256] # ❌ `dict` is forbidden!
    # b: TreeMap             # ❌ only fully specialized generic types are allowed!
    b: TreeMap[Address, u256]
    # d: int                 # ❌ `int` is forbidden
    d: bigint                # ⚠️ most likely you don't need an arbitrary big integer
    d_sized: i256
```

## Few words about `DynArray` and `TreeMap`

These types implement python `collections.abc.MutableSequence` and `collections.abc.MutableMapping` which makes them compatible with most of the python code

They can be encoded into calldata as-is as well, which means that following code is correct:

```py
class PersistentContract(gl.Contract):
    storage: DynArray[str]

    @gl.public.view
    def get_complete_storage(self) -> collections.abc.Sequence[str]:
        return self.storage
```

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
    Calldata format supports mappings only with `str` keys, like JSON does.
</Callout>

## Using custom data types

You can use other python classes in storage, for example:

```py
@allow_storage
@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    birthday: datetime.datetime

class Contract(gl.Contract):
    users: DynArray[User]
```

Note that you must decorate them with `@allow_storage`. This is done to prevent [confusion](#differences-from-regular-python-types)

However, there is a tricky case: allocating storage generics in-memory. It is different from regular python syntax because storage types don't have type erasure due to fixed memory layout.

```py
@allow_storage
@dataclass
class User:
    data: TreeMap[str, str]

User() # error: data is absent (from dataclass)
User(gl.storage.inmem_allocate(TreeMap[str, str])) # works fine, this function takes a type and `*args, **kwargs` for corresponding `__init__`. Also note that type must be fully instantiated and have no type variables.
```

## Default values
By default storage is zero-initialized:
| Type       | Default value |
|------------|---------------|
| `u*`, `i*` | `0`           |
| `bool`     | `false`       |
| `float`    | `+0`          |
| `str`      | `""`          |
| `DynArray` | `[]`          |
| `TreeMap`  | `{}`          |

Struct types are zero-initialized "recursively"

## Memory Management

### `gl.storage.inmem_allocate`

Required for **generic storage classes** only. Regular dataclasses use normal initialization.

```python
# { "Depends": "py-genlayer:test" }

from genlayer import *
from dataclasses import dataclass
import datetime

@allow_storage
@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    birthday: datetime.datetime

@allow_storage
@dataclass
class Gen[T]:
    name: T
    birthday: datetime.datetime

class Contract(gl.Contract):
    user: User
    gen_user: Gen[bytes]

    @gl.public.write
    def plain(self):
        user = User('Ada', datetime.datetime.now())
        self.user = user

        read_user = self.user
        copied_out = gl.storage.copy_to_memory(read_user)

        def nd():
            print('inmem: ok', user)
            try:
                print('storage: not ok', str(read_user))
            except Exception as e:
                print('storage: not ok', e)
            print('copied out: ok', copied_out)

        gl.eq_principle.strict_eq(nd)

    @gl.public.write
    def generic(self):
        user = gl.storage.inmem_allocate(Gen[bytes], b'Ada', datetime.datetime.now())
        self.gen_user = user

        read_user = self.gen_user
        copied_out = gl.storage.copy_to_memory(read_user)

        def nd():
            print('inmem: ok', user)
            try:
                print('storage: not ok', str(read_user))
            except Exception as e:
                print('storage: not ok', e)
            print('copied out: ok', copied_out)

        gl.eq_principle.strict_eq(nd)
```

### `gl.storage.copy_to_memory`

Storage objects cannot be converted to string safely. Copy them to memory first:

```python
# Read from storage
storage_user = self.user

# Copy to memory for safe usage
memory_user = gl.storage.copy_to_memory(storage_user)

# String conversion works with memory objects
print('copied out: ok', memory_user)  # Works!
print('storage: not ok', str(storage_user))  # Error!

```

## Differences from regular python types
Even though storage classes mimic python types, remember that they provide you only with a view on memory, not actual data that is "here". For example, consider the above example

```py
self.users.append(User("Ada"))
user = self.users[-1]
self.users[-1] = User("Definitely not Ada", datetime.datetime.now())
assert user.name == "Definitely not Ada" # this is true!
```
