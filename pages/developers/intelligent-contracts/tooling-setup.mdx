## Using the GenLayer Studio

The GenLayer Studio is a web-based interface for developing, testing, and deploying Intelligent Contracts. It provides a user-friendly environment for interacting with the GenLayer ecosystem. You can find it at [studio.genlayer.com](https://studio.genlayer.com).

## Local Installation of the GenLayer CLI

The GenLayer CLI is used to set up the GenLayer Studio and, in the future, mainnet and testnet environments.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed and updated:

</div>

### Installation Steps

1. **Install GenLayer CLI**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   npm install -g genlayer
   ```

2. **Initialize GenLayer Environment**

   Run the following command to set up your development environment:

   ```bash
   genlayer init
   ```

   During initialization, you'll be prompted to select your preferred LLM provider(s) and enter any required API keys.

   **Optional Initialization Parameters**

   You can customize the initialization with the following options:

   - `--numValidators <number>`: Specify the number of validators (default is 5)
   - `--headless`: Run in headless mode without UI (default is false)
   - `--reset-db`: Reset the database to a clean state (default is false)
   - `--localnet-version <version>`: Specify the localnet version to use (default is latest stable version)

   Example:

   ```bash
   genlayer init --numValidators 3 --headless --reset-db --localnet-version v0.32.1
   ```

## Launching the GenLayer Studio

After initializing the environment, you can start the Studio by running:

```bash
genlayer up
```

This command launches the GenLayer Studio using your existing configuration.

**Optional Parameters:**
- `--reset-validators`: Removes all current validators and creates new ones.
- `--numValidators <number>`: Specify the number of validators to start.
- `--headless`: Run in headless mode without UI (default is false)
- `--reset-db`: Reset the database to a clean state (default is false)

Example:

```bash
genlayer up --reset-validators --numValidators 3 --headless --reset-db
```

Once the Studio is running, access it at http://localhost:8080/.

## Writing Intelligent Contracts

Refer to the [Your First Contract](./your-first-contract) page for more information on how to write Intelligent Contracts.

## Deploying and Interacting with Intelligent Contracts

### Deploying the Contract

1. **Load Your Contract**
<br/>In the GenLayer Studio, navigate to the Contracts section and upload your contract file.


3. **Deploy the Contract**
<br/>Navigate to the Run and Deploy section and click the "Deploy" button. 
<br/>The Studio will automatically detect constructor parameters. Provide the required values.
<br/>Upon successful deployment, the contract address will be displayed.

### Interacting with the Contract

1. **Read Methods**
<br/>View the current state of the contract using Read Methods. These are methods that return data without modifying the state.

2. **Write Methods**
<br/>Execute Write Methods to interact with your contract. Provide any required input parameters.

3. **Execution Logs**
<br/>Monitor transactions and validator consensus via the Node Logs at the bottom of the Studio.

4. **Transaction Details**
<br/>View detailed information about a transaction by clicking on it in the bottom left list of transactions.
