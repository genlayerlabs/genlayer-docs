# Staking Contract Guide

This guide covers consensus-level staking operations for developers who want to interact directly with the GenLayer staking smart contracts. It includes Solidity code examples for both validator and delegator operations.

To understand the concepts behind staking—including the epoch system, shares vs stake, validator selection weights, and reward distribution—see [Staking in GenLayer](/understand-genlayer-protocol/core-concepts/optimistic-democracy/staking).

## Validator Operations

### Joining as a Validator

**Requirements:**
- Minimum stake: **42,000 GEN** tokens
- Must run a validator node for consensus participation
- A single address can create multiple validators

**Method 1: Owner as Operator**

```solidity
address validatorWallet = genStaking.validatorJoin{value: 42000 ether}();
```

**Method 2: Separate Operator Address (Recommended)**

```solidity
address operatorAddress = 0x...;
address validatorWallet = genStaking.validatorJoin{value: 42000 ether}(operatorAddress);
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Save the returned **ValidatorWallet address** - you'll need it for all future operations.
</Callout>

**Important Notes:**
- Deposits activate **2 epochs after joining**
- `validatorPrime()` is automatically called by your validator node each epoch
- Monitor priming for proper activation within 2 epochs
- Operator address cannot be reused or be the zero address
- If the operator is already assigned to another validator, the transaction reverts

**Post-Join Steps:**
1. Save the `validatorWallet` address
2. Start your validator node using the operator address
3. Monitor that `validatorPrime(validatorWallet)` executes each epoch
4. Wait 2 epochs and verify activation

### Depositing as a Validator

```solidity
validatorWallet.validatorDeposit{value: 10000 ether}();
```

**Key Points:**
- Call through the ValidatorWallet contract only
- Deposits follow the **epoch +2 activation rule**
- Your validator node automatically calls `validatorPrime()` to commit the deposit
- No minimum for additional deposits
- Cannot deposit zero value

**Activation Timeline:**
```
Epoch N:   validatorDeposit() called
Epoch N+1: validatorPrime() → deposit staged
Epoch N+2: validatorPrime() → deposit activated
```

### Withdrawing as a Validator

**Step 1: Calculate Shares**

```solidity
uint256[8] memory validatorState = genStaking.validatorView(validatorWallet);
uint256 currentShares = validatorState[1];
uint256 currentStake = validatorState[0];
uint256 sharesToExit = (currentShares * 30) / 100; // Exit 30%
```

**Step 2: Initiate Exit**

```solidity
validatorWallet.validatorExit(sharesToExit);
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You must specify **shares**, not token amounts. Cannot exit more shares than owned.
</Callout>

**Important Notes:**
- Exited tokens stop earning rewards immediately
- Tokens are locked for **7 epochs** before claiming
- Each exit creates a separate withdrawal

**Unbonding Timeline:**
```
Epoch 10:    validatorExit() called → unbonding starts
Epochs 11-16: Locked period
Epoch 17:    validatorClaim() available
```

### Claiming Withdrawn Funds as a Validator

```solidity
uint256 tokensReceived = genStaking.validatorClaim(validatorWallet);
```

**Important Notes:**
- Must wait **7 full epochs** after calling `validatorExit()`
- Claims are permissionless - anyone can trigger them
- Tokens are sent to the validator wallet's owner address
- Multiple exits can be claimed in a single call
- Returns the total GEN received

**Checking Claim Availability:**

```solidity
uint256 exitEpoch = 10;
uint256 claimableAtEpoch = exitEpoch + 7;
uint256 currentEpoch = genStaking.epoch();
if (currentEpoch >= claimableAtEpoch) {
    genStaking.validatorClaim(validatorWallet);
}
```

## Delegator Operations

### Joining as a Delegator

**Requirements:**
- Minimum delegation: **42 GEN** per validator
- Target validator must exist and be active
- Can delegate to multiple validators

**Basic Delegation:**

```solidity
address validatorWallet = 0x...;
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 1000 ether}(validatorWallet);
```

**Multi-Validator Delegation:**

```solidity
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 500 ether}(validator1);
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 500 ether}(validator2);
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 500 ether}(validator3);
```

**Important Notes:**
- Follows the **epoch +2 activation rule**
- The validator's node automatically calls `validatorPrime()` to commit your delegation
- Choose validators with good uptime
- Smaller validators often provide higher returns
- Cannot delegate zero value

**Delegation Strategy Tips:**
- Diversify across multiple validators
- Check validator performance and uptime
- Monitor validator quarantine/ban status

### Depositing as a Delegator

```solidity
genStaking.delegatorDeposit{value: 500 ether}(validatorWallet);
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use `delegatorDeposit()` to add to existing delegations
- Follows the **epoch +2 activation rule**
- The validator's node automatically calls `validatorPrime()`
- No minimum for additional deposits
- Rewards automatically compound

### Withdrawing as a Delegator

**Step 1: Calculate Shares**

```solidity
uint256 currentShares = genStaking.sharesOf(msg.sender, validatorWallet);
uint256 sharesToExit = (currentShares * 50) / 100; // Exit 50%
```

**Step 2: Initiate Exit**

```solidity
genStaking.delegatorExit(validatorWallet, sharesToExit);
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You must specify **shares**, not token amounts.
</Callout>

**Important Notes:**
- Can exit partial amounts
- Stop earning rewards immediately after exit
- Tokens are locked for **7 epochs**
- Exit each validator separately if delegating to multiple

**Unbonding Timeline:**
```
Epoch 5:     delegatorExit() called
Epochs 6-11: Locked period
Epoch 12:    delegatorClaim() available
```

### Claiming Withdrawn Funds as a Delegator

```solidity
uint256 tokensReceived = genStaking.delegatorClaim(
    delegatorAddress,
    validatorWallet
);
```

**Important Notes:**
- Must wait **7 full epochs** after calling `delegatorExit()`
- Claims are permissionless - anyone can trigger them
- Tokens are sent to the delegator's address
- Claim from each validator separately if delegated to multiple

**Multi-Validator Claim Example:**

```solidity
genStaking.delegatorClaim(msg.sender, validator1);
genStaking.delegatorClaim(msg.sender, validator2);
genStaking.delegatorClaim(msg.sender, validator3);
```

## Genesis Epoch 0

Epoch 0 is the **genesis bootstrapping period** with special rules designed to facilitate network launch. The normal staking rules are relaxed to allow rapid network bootstrapping.

### What is Epoch 0?

Epoch 0 is the **bootstrapping period** before the network becomes operational. During epoch 0:

- **No transactions are processed** - the network is not yet active
- **No consensus occurs** - validators are not yet participating
- Stakes are registered and prepared for activation in epoch 2

**Important**: The network transitions directly from epoch 0 to epoch 2 (epoch 1 is skipped). Validators and delegators who stake in epoch 0 become active in epoch 2.

### Special Rules for Epoch 0

| Rule | Normal Epochs (2+) | Epoch 0 |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Validator minimum stake | 42,000 GEN | No minimum to join |
| Delegator minimum stake | 42 GEN | No minimum to join |
| Activation delay | +2 epochs | Active in epoch 2 |
| validatorPrime required | Yes, each epoch | Not required |
| Share calculation | Based on existing ratio | 1:1 (shares = input) |
| Transaction processing | Yes | No (bootstrapping only) |

<Callout type="warning">
  **Activation requires meeting minimums**: While you can join with any amount during epoch 0, your stake will only be **activated in epoch 2** if it meets the minimum requirements (42,000 GEN for validators, 42 GEN for delegators). Stakes below the minimum remain registered but inactive.
</Callout>

### Validators in Epoch 0

**Joining:**

```solidity
// In epoch 0, any amount is accepted (no 42,000 GEN minimum)
address validatorWallet = genStaking.validatorJoin{value: 1000 ether}(operatorAddress);

// Stake is registered for activation in epoch 2
// No need to call validatorPrime() in epoch 0
```

**Key behaviors:**

1. **No minimum stake**: Validators can join with any non-zero amount
2. **Registered for epoch 2**: Stakes are recorded and will become active when epoch 2 begins
3. **No priming required**: `validatorPrime()` is not needed during epoch 0
4. **No consensus participation**: Validators do not process transactions in epoch 0

**Do validators need to take any action in epoch 0 to be active in epoch 2?**

No. Validators who join in epoch 0:

- Have their stake registered during epoch 0
- Become active automatically in epoch 2 (epoch 1 is skipped) **only if they have at least 42,000 GEN staked**
- Must start calling `validatorPrime()` in epoch 2 for continued participation in epoch 4+

<Callout type="error">
  **Critical**: Validators who joined in epoch 0 with less than 42,000 GEN will **not be active** in epoch 2. They must deposit additional funds to meet the minimum requirement before epoch 2 begins.
</Callout>

### Delegators in Epoch 0

**Joining:**

```solidity
// In epoch 0, any amount is accepted (no 42 GEN minimum)
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 10 ether}(validatorWallet);

// Delegation is registered for activation in epoch 2
```

**Key behaviors:**

1. **No minimum delegation**: Any non-zero amount accepted
2. **Registered for epoch 2**: Delegation is recorded and will become active when epoch 2 begins
3. **No rewards in epoch 0**: Since no transactions are processed, no rewards are earned during epoch 0

**Is a delegation made in epoch 0 active in epoch 2?**

Yes. Delegations made in epoch 0 become active in epoch 2 (epoch 1 is skipped). Unlike normal epochs where you wait +2 epochs, epoch 0 delegations activate as soon as the network becomes operational.

### Activation Timeline Comparison

**Normal Epochs (2+):**

```
Epoch N:   validatorJoin() or delegatorJoin() called
Epoch N+1: validatorPrime() stages the deposit
Epoch N+2: validatorPrime() activates the deposit → NOW ACTIVE
```

**Epoch 0 (Bootstrapping):**

```
Epoch 0: validatorJoin() or delegatorJoin() called → stake registered (not yet active)
         No transactions processed, no consensus
Epoch 2: Stakes become active (if minimum met), network operational, validatorPrime() required
```

### Share Calculation in Epoch 0

In epoch 0, shares are calculated at a 1:1 ratio with the input amount:

```solidity
// Epoch 0: 1,000 GEN deposit = 1,000 shares (1:1 ratio)
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 1000 ether}(validatorWallet);
// Result: delegator receives exactly 1,000 shares

// Normal epochs: shares depend on pool ratio
// new_shares = deposit_amount × (total_shares / total_stake)
```

This is because there's no existing stake pool to calculate a ratio against. Starting from epoch 2, shares are calculated based on the current stake-to-share ratio.

### Transitioning from Epoch 0 to Epoch 2

When the network advances from epoch 0 to epoch 2 (epoch 1 is skipped):

1. **Epoch 0 stakes that meet minimums become active** - validators need 42,000 GEN, delegators need 42 GEN
2. **Normal minimum requirements apply** for new joins/deposits
3. **+2 epoch activation delay** applies to all new deposits
4. **validatorPrime() becomes mandatory** for validators to remain in the selection pool
5. **Existing validators** must ensure their nodes begin calling `validatorPrime()` in epoch 2

### FAQ: Epoch 0 Special Cases

**Q: Can I join as a validator with less than 42,000 GEN in epoch 0?**
A: Yes, any non-zero amount is accepted during epoch 0. However, you will **not be active** in epoch 2 unless you have at least 42,000 GEN staked by then.

**Q: If I delegate in epoch 0, when does it become active?**
A: In epoch 2. Unlike normal epochs with a +2 delay, epoch 0 delegations activate when the network becomes operational.

**Q: Do I need to call validatorPrime() in epoch 0?**
A: No. Priming is not required during epoch 0. Your node should start calling it automatically when epoch 2 begins (epoch 1 is skipped).

**Q: Will my epoch 0 stake still be active after epoch 0 ends?**
A: Yes, if you meet the minimum requirements. Stakes from epoch 0 carry forward and remain active in all subsequent epochs.

**Q: What happens to my stake if I joined in epoch 0 but my node doesn't call validatorPrime() in epoch 2?**
A: You'll be excluded from validator selection in epoch 4, but your stake remains. Once priming resumes, you'll be eligible for selection again.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Becoming a Validator

```solidity
address validatorWallet = genStaking.validatorJoin{value: 42000 ether}(operatorAddress);
// Start validator node with operator address
// Monitor: Epoch N joined, N+1 staged, N+2 active
```

### Scenario 2: Delegating to Multiple Validators

```solidity
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 1000 ether}(validator1);
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 2000 ether}(validator2);
genStaking.delegatorJoin{value: 1500 ether}(validator3);

// Later, exit from one validator
uint256 shares = genStaking.sharesOf(msg.sender, validator1);
genStaking.delegatorExit(validator1, shares);

// After 7 epochs:
genStaking.delegatorClaim(msg.sender, validator1);
```

### Scenario 3: Partial Validator Exit

```solidity
uint256[8] memory state = genStaking.validatorView(validatorWallet);
uint256 currentShares = state[1];
uint256 sharesToExit = (currentShares * 25) / 100; // Exit 25%
validatorWallet.validatorExit(sharesToExit);

// After 7 epochs:
genStaking.validatorClaim(validatorWallet);
```

## Best Practices

### For Validators

1. **Ensure node health**: Your validator node automatically calls `validatorPrime()`
2. **Use separate keys**: Cold wallet for owner, hot wallet for operator
3. **Monitor priming**: Verify deposit activation occurs as expected
4. **Monitor quarantine status**: Check if your validator is quarantined
5. **Maintain high uptime**: Downtime leads to idleness strikes
6. **Set up backup monitoring**: Alert if priming fails

### For Delegators

1. **Diversify**: Spread stake across multiple validators
2. **Select carefully**: Choose validators with good uptime records
3. **Verify priming**: Ensure validators are consistently primed
4. **Consider smaller validators**: They often provide higher returns
5. **Monitor health**: Regularly check validator status
6. **Use shares for exits**: Calculate percentages, not absolute amounts

### For Both

1. **Account for unbonding**: Plan for the 7-epoch wait when exiting
2. **Monitor epochs**: Track current epoch for claim eligibility
3. **Calculate exits carefully**: Always use share percentages
4. **Understand compounding**: Rewards automatically increase stake-per-share
5. **Watch governance**: Parameter changes can affect staking dynamics

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ValidatorBelowMinimumStake` | Stake below 42,000 GEN | Deposit at least 42,000 GEN when joining |
| `OperatorAlreadyAssigned` | Operator address in use | Choose a different operator address |
| `ValidatorMayNotDepositZeroValue` | Zero deposit amount | Deposit a non-zero amount |
| `ValidatorExitExceedsShares` | Exiting more shares than owned | Check shares with `validatorView()` |
| Validator not selected | Node not priming | Ensure node runs and calls `validatorPrime()` |
| Stake not activating | Priming not occurring | Monitor node for automatic `validatorPrime()` calls |
| Cannot claim withdrawn funds | Unbonding not complete | Verify 7 epochs have passed with `genStaking.epoch()` |
| Delegation not earning | Validator issues | Check if validator is quarantined/banned; consider switching |
