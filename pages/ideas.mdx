|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prediction Markets                  | Use GenLayer as an oracle to resolve any prediction market, allowing users to place bets on future events and get outcomes automatically determined.                                           |
| Parametric Insurance                | Create insurance that pays out based on real-world events, such as drought conditions or natural disasters, using data fetched from reliable sources.                                          |
| Bounty Review and Payout            | Automatically reward community members for completing tasks like writing articles or developing features by evaluating their work using intelligent contracts.                                   |
| Performance-based Contracting       | Set up contracts that pay out based on the completion of pre-agreed jobs, such as developing a website or creating a piece of content, with performance verified through automated checks.       |
| Slashing Monitoring and Insurance   | Monitor protocols for any violations and trigger slashing events or provide insurance payouts based on human-in-the-loop evaluations or LLM-based assessments.                                   |
| Hack Detection and Emergency Pause  | Set up contracts that continuously monitor for potential protocol attacks through explorers and news sites, and trigger automated emergency shutdowns if threats are detected.                    |
| On-chain Identity Verification      | Verify users' identities by checking their social media profiles for specific messages and linking these to their on-chain accounts, enhancing trust in the ecosystem.                           |
| Under-collateralized Lending        | Enable lending with less collateral by linking real-world identity to on-chain reputation, allowing borrowers to leverage their good standing for better loan terms.                             |
| P2P Gambling                        | Allow two users to place bets on real-world outcomes, with the contract determining the winner based on data from trusted sources.                                                             |
| Decentralized Game Master           | Facilitate text-based role-playing games where users submit their actions, and the intelligent contract determines the outcomes, creating a dynamic and interactive gaming experience.             |
| Interoperable Games with NFTs       | Develop games that issue and recognize automatically generated NFT items, allowing players to transfer assets seamlessly between different games within the ecosystem.                            |
| Unstoppable Organizations           | Create autonomous entities like DAOs that can adapt and continue their missions indefinitely as long as they remain funded, including AI DAOs and autonomous trusts.                            |
| Retroactive Public Goods Funding    | Set up contracts that reward contributions to the protocol retroactively, incentivizing community members to make valuable improvements and innovations.                                          |
| Crowd-sourced Knowledge Database    | Implement a system where users are rewarded for finding and summarizing new information on various topics, building a comprehensive knowledge base.                                              |
| AI Notary                           | Create an automated notary service that can confirm the occurrence of online events, providing verifiable records for various purposes.                                                         |
| AI Arbitration                      | Develop a dispute resolution system where parties submit their cases to an AI-based arbitrator, which makes decisions based on pre-defined legal frameworks and submitted evidence.               |
| Private P2P Contracts               | Enable two-party contracts that remain private unless a dispute arises, using a commit/reveal scheme to keep terms confidential until necessary.                                                  |
| Multi-modal Use Cases               | Integrate real-world images for performance-based contracting, such as verifying the completion of physical tasks, with cryptographically signed proofs.                                           |
| Generative Memes                    | Create fun and engaging intelligent contracts, like ones that track and manipulate token balances in creative ways, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs for humor and experimentation.            |
| Text-based Intelligent Contracts    | Open the possibility for non-developers to create intelligent contracts by capturing the entire logic in plain text, making smart contract development more accessible.                           |
| Honeypot Contracts for Security     | Set up intelligent contracts designed to attract and test adversarial attacks, helping to identify and fix vulnerabilities through real-world testing.                                            |
| Fair and Transparent Moderation     | Use GenLayer-based arbitration to make fair and transparent moderation decisions in various communities and games, ensuring unbiased and consistent enforcement of rules.                           |
