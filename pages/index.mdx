# Welcome to GenLayer Docs 
GenLayer is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to execute AI-powered smart contracts called **Intelligent Contracts** which can use AI models to search the web and process natural language instructions.

To navigate the docs, the sidebar on the left organizes the documentation, one can start with knowing generic concepts [about the GenLayer Protocol](), and 
then choosing a path as a [User](), [Developer]() or [Protocol Contributor]().
