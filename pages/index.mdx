# Welcome to GenLayer docs 
GenLayer is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to execute AI-powered smart contracts called **Intelligent Contracts** that uses AI models to search the web and process natural language instructions.

## What makes GenLayer different
GenLayer stands out with a unique set of features that empower developers to create innovative and intelligent decentralized applications:

#### üåê Process Natural Language
GenLayer introduces Intelligent Contracts that can interpret and execute instructions written in natural language. This capability allows for more complex, context-aware operations that go beyond traditional smart contracts.

#### üîÑ Access Web Data Directly
Unlike conventional blockchain platforms, GenLayer enables Intelligent Contracts to directly access and utilize real-time data from the web. This opens up new possibilities for creating dynamic applications that respond to external events and data sources.

#### üß† Optimistic Democracy Consensus
GenLayer employs a cutting-edge consensus mechanism known as Optimistic Democracy. This approach enhances security and efficiency by allowing transactions to be validated and finalized quickly, with the flexibility to appeal and re-evaluate in case of disputes.

#### üêç Developer-Friendly Language
Building on GenLayer is made easier with a developer-friendly language that simplifies the creation of Intelligent Contracts. Whether you're new to blockchain development or an experienced coder, GenLayer's tools are designed to streamline your workflow and accelerate innovation.
