# Welcome to GenLayer 
## The Intelligence Layer of the Internet. 

GenLayer is a new class of DLT capable of non deterministic operations though a dynamic consensus mechanism, by leveraging the [Jury Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem) ("wisdom of the crowd") and [Schelling Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) mechanics.


#### In other words, GenLayer is the first Intelligent Blockchain. Enabling smart contracts to natively access the internet and go beyond deterministic logic, to make subjective decisions.

- **Bitcoin is Trustless Money,**<br />
- **Ethereum is Trustless Applications,**<br />
- **GenLayer is Trustless Decision-Making.**

GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts can connect to the Internet, process natural language, and handle non-deterministic operations such as making subjective decisions, enabling a whole new generation of smart contract logic that is not possible under the limitations of current blockchain infrastructure.

See some of the usecases [here](/understand-genlayer-protocol/typical-use-cases).

Protocols and applications that can **understand, learn, and adapt to real-world events.**
